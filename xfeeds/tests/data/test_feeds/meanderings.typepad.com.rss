<p>After spending all of our allowance at the bookstore, we decided to splurge on brunch. This great little place just down the street from the bookstore,&#0160;<a href="http://www.theravengrill.com/" target="_self" title="">The Raven Grill</a>&#0160;was our choice. Good food, good books, now for a good afternoon doing what I like the best,,,kicking back with a good book and a cold drink!</p></div>

<p>For about $299 you can get the Thync device, 10 calming strips and 10 energy strip (use one strip each time). &#0160;Do the math and you get $14.95 for each hit.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t tried this, I&#39;m not being paid to write about it, but it does sound interesting if it works.</p>
<p>If&#0160;<a href="http://www.thync.com/" target="_self" title="">Thync</a>&#0160;wants me to try this out I would be more than willing!!</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I love to read. Most people know that about me. I once lay on a porch swing at my Grandmother&#39;s house from dusk to dawn and read the entire book <em>Gone With the Wind</em>. I have been known to stay up all night to finish reading a good book.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The last book I read, however, I pitched down when I was about half-way finished with it. Our book club meets this Saturday to discuss <em>In The Garden of Beasts</em> by Erik Larson. I usually like a story based on happenings during WWII (this one is fiction). I kept reading because some books take forever to set up, but that didn&#39;t happen with this one. Another member of the book club had as difficult of a time in reading this book as I did, but she did finish it. I, however, decided if she didn&#39;t like it after reading the whole thing and I didn&#39;t like it after only reading half of it then it really wasn&#39;t worth wasting my time on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Anyone else read this book? Did you like it or find it pretty boring?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Just wondering,,,</p>

Sometimes a proverb, a Bible quote, or sometimes just her opinion. (Heaven help you if you didn&#39;t agree!)</p>
<p>I like to whistle. I whistle while I work. I whistle when I&#39;m happy. Sometimes I whistle when I&#39;m sad or worried.</p>
<p>If Grandma caught me whistling she would tell me &quot;A whistling girl and a crowing hen, always come to some bad end&quot;.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t for the life of me ever figure out why a hen would crow!</p>
<p>The earliest recorded version of this proverb is Scottish, and dates from 1721: &quot;A crooning cow, a crowing Hen and a whistling Maid boded never luck to a house&quot; (&quot;Complete Collection of Scottish Proverbs, Explained and made Intelligible to the English Reader&quot;, by J Kelly.) (VSD)</p>
<p>I suppose to whistle is unladylike as Jo was told in &quot;Little Women&quot;.</p>
<p>So, only men are supposed to whistle? If a woman whistled she was trying to be like a man?</p>
<p>Times have changed since my Grandmother&#39;s day. Women <em>can</em> and <em>do</em> work in a &#39;man&#39;s world&#39; doing a &#39;man&#39;s job&#39;.&#0160;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I&#39;ll continue to whistle while I work and go my merry way!!</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>My grandmother always had a quote for just about any situation. When we would ask, for instance, if we could go somewhere or do something special, her pat answer would always be &quot;The good Lord willing and the creek don&#39;t rise.&quot; I always thought she meant if the good Lord allowed us and the creek just down the road from her house didn&#39;t flood so we couldn&#39;t get to town.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when I actually researched the origin of the quote and found it has been attributed to Benjamin Hawkins. In the 1800&#39;s he was asked to come to the capital and his answer was &quot;God willing and the Creeks don&#39;t rise&quot; meaning if the Lord found it favorable and the Indians (Creeks) didn&#39;t rise up in rebellion.</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t it funny how what we imagine a quote to mean and what the original meaning was sometimes is completely off base?&#0160;</p>
<p>I&#39;ll still think of a flooding creek and not an Indian uprising whenever I hear someone say that!</p></div>

<p>Please, everyone who votes, please research each candidate before voting. What did they say they were going to do? What have they done already or in the past?</p>
<p>I&#39;m reminded of&#0160;King Crimson&#39;s, Epitaph, (you can find it on YouTube&#0160;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLHScgTJ9eQ" target="_blank" title="">here</a>&#0160;).</p>
<p>Without good leaders this may paint the picture of an all too probable ending as history repeats itself!</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Knowledge is a deadly friend</strong></p>
<p><strong> When no one sets the rules</strong></p>
<p><strong> The fate of all mankind I see</strong></p>
<p><strong> Is in the hands of fools&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t care what party you support. It doesn&#39;t matter. We need to KNOW who we are voting for. Research people! Decide who will be the best person to run this great country of ours! Support that person by sharing what you know.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t blindly follow like sheep.&#0160;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t put our country into the hands of fools!</p></div>

<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>We didn&#39;t get a lot of pictures on our cruise. Reason number 1, well hey, we were celebrating our anniversary! Reason number 2 - the countries the cruise stopped in had cement walls between the &quot;tourist&quot; areas and the rest of the country. The only way you were permitted to go outside those walls was to go on an &quot;excursion&quot; approved by them and the cruise lines. Sorry, I really don&#39;t want to see the country side if I&#39;m in danger!&#0160;</p>
<p>I found it really ironic that when we entered Mexico there were drug sniffing dogs waiting to check us out when we got off the ship. <em>Really???</em>&#0160;</p>
<p>I did get a few pictures, though, and will share when I get caught up with things here at home!</p>
