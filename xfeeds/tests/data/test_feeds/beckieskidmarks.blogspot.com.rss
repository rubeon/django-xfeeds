Due to her boyfriend/common law hubby (they&#39;ve been together longer than most people have been married and if half that time had been here in Texas, the law would agree) not being here, I was the birthing coach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had a really cool spacious room with a DVD player, wood floors, attentive nurses and a great doctor. After she had the baby, she was moved to her own private room that was still pretty spacious. The nurses kept the baby in the nursery and let her sleep all night! She got the absolute best care Texas can provide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by Texas, I mean the taxpayers &#39;cuz my sis&#39; didn&#39;t pay a dime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, don&#39;t get me wrong, I sure as hell didn&#39;t want her having the baby in some back alley or homeless hostel where afterwards the ambulance would drop her and the baby off on some street corner where all the drug addicts and mentally insane hang out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why...WHY couldn&#39;t I have gotten some of the same kind of treatment where I had my kids at a military hospital? Whenever I read the news about how shocked everyone is about the appalling state of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/17/AR2007021701172.html&quot;&gt;military hospitals &lt;/a&gt; and the sub-standard care they have, I just have to say where the hell have you been? With my son, I didn&#39;t get an epidural. I got some kind of generic drug that did shit for me then made me puke my brains out a few hours later. Did I have a choice to be guinea pig? Nope. By the time a friend of mine had her baby a few months later, she got the epidural, thanks to yours truly. I didn&#39;t even get $20 for my services for their little drug experiment. When I had my daughter, the doctors blew off a cyst I had on one of my ovaries until I was too far along in my pregnancy. When I finally got sent to a high-risk doctor ( at an Air Force hospital, mind you, which are far more superior than Army hospitals but are getting closed down so all that are left are the Army hospitals), I had to wait til after I had her, then they had to take my whole ovary out along with the cyst. And the nurses...my GOD....they look at you like some kind of negligent monster if you ask for a little sleep time. No nurseries for healthy babies, baby stays with you the whole time. I was positively dying to leave the hospital. I got better care at home, caring for myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And its not me either. Whenever I talk about my nightmare stays at a military hospital, someone usually has a story of their own about a family or friend. Problem is, they are all still green. They all still have to pull out their trusty medical book or consult someone who has a couple of years on them but not much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#39;t make enough to have my kids on my medical plan. It would take too much out each month, so they are still on my ex&#39;s military medical plan. Which means, in our area, it&#39;s a military hospital. I used to always go to the Air Force one here, but now, we have to go to the Army one. Thankfully, my kids are never sicker than the common stuff that a green doctor or nurse or whoever is there sees pretty much every day and knows the standard Tylenol or Amoxicillan treatment. Now that my ex finally got a job though, maybe the kids can go on something his job offers or he can give me some extra support to make up the difference on my jobs&#39; medical plan. All I know is, I sure don&#39;t want them to get in some car accident and go to a military hospital. I cringe everytime I hear in the news the person went there, &#39;cuz I know the kind of treatment they got. I hope one day soon, I can get them to someone who really does know what they are talking about. A real pediatric doctor and not someone who has to do this part as part of their training, or still trying it out to see if this is the field they want to really get into to. Or having nurses still working on their bedside manners or, otherwise, really don&#39;t give a damn either way &#39;cuz its a miliary hospital after all and they get paid according to rank and patients come and go and don&#39;t have a choice either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since we&#39;re talking about being jealous about stuff.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone I work with is a really rich girl from the Chicago area and for some reason is determined to show her family she is not Paris Hilton and can make it on her own. So, she got married recently and is now definetely not running back home anytime soon, at least. So her parents finally gave in and bought a summer home here in SA to be near her....at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.celebritydetective.com/cmntyprofile-stonecold.html&quot;&gt;DOMINION&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who does that?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://beckieskidmarks.blogspot.com/feeds/5037793767664562533/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10001603&amp;postID=5037793767664562533' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10001603/posts/default/5037793767664562533'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10001603/posts/default/5037793767664562533'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://beckieskidmarks.blogspot.com/2007/08/jealous-much.html' title='Jealous Much?'/><author><name>Beckie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09760935813783707983</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10001603.post-9021307670730180384</id><published>2007-08-09T20:57:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-08-09T21:20:57.490-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Top of the World Ma!</title><content type='html'>Well, I did it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a promotion and made Processor 1. I&#39;m pretty excited. I got the highest raise (9%) and, of course, bragging rights! Of course, now the pressure is on to know my stuff and maintain the high expectations. Yes, it can and will all be taken away from me if I slip. Which is why I hadn&#39;t really wanted it in the first place so I didn&#39;t really ask or push for it. Pressure and stress happens to put, well, a lot of pressure and stress on me. So, we&#39;ll see what happens, and hopefully I can hang on to it long enough so it wouldn&#39;t be too &lt;span class=&quot;blsp-spelling-corrected&quot; id=&quot;SPELLING_ERROR_0&quot;&gt;embarrassing&lt;/span&gt; if they took it away from me. I know, the cup is always half empty from where I sit. I need to work on that, but I&#39;m a big worrier and I&#39;m always afraid if I get too much of a big head, something horrible will happen, so I&#39;m always waiting for the other shoe to drop. My life has always had some kind of chaotic mess or disaster befall me just when I start getting comfortable, so let&#39;s pray I don&#39;t get cancer or something!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I finally met &lt;a href=&quot;http://spelledwithani.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Kristen&lt;/a&gt;! She looks &lt;em&gt;absolutely fabulous&lt;/em&gt;! We work just a floor away from &lt;span class=&quot;blsp-spelling-corrected&quot; id=&quot;SPELLING_ERROR_1&quot;&gt;each other&lt;/span&gt; and she finally came by to say HI ! She is super sweet, and although I never saw her before she lost all the weight, I can say if she loses any more she will disappear! I have a lot of respect and admiration for her determination to lose the poundage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another side note, does anyone know how to potty train a dog?  I  have a minature pincher who we got when he was already 2 yrs old and now he&#39;s 3 yrs old and has always been an outside dog from what I understand.  He&#39;s also a runner, which is how we got him ( he was too much trouble for a friend of mine).  He&#39;s run away too many times and in order to avoid the drama of upsetting my kids, I&#39;ve decided to leave him in the house.  He stays in one of the bathrooms with a doggy potty mat, and he&#39;s going on it (and a little on the floor too!).  I thought I was supposed to be teaching him to hold it, but I think I&#39;m just teaching him to go on the mat!  I take him out before we leave in the morning and a couple of times when we get home.  He doesn&#39;t go at all throughout the night, so what am I doing wrong?  Every evening when I get home now, the first thing I have to do is mop the bathroom floor!  It&#39;s getting more than a little frustrating.  Any tips are welcome!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://beckieskidmarks.blogspot.com/feeds/9021307670730180384/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10001603&amp;postID=9021307670730180384' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10001603/posts/default/9021307670730180384'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10001603/posts/default/9021307670730180384'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://beckieskidmarks.blogspot.com/2007/08/top-of-world-ma.html' title='Top of the World Ma!'/><author><name>Beckie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09760935813783707983</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10001603.post-538115494126969469</id><published>2007-06-23T21:51:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-06-23T22:18:52.303-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Hail to the Chief</title><content type='html'>Well, yours truly did it...I made the Presidents Club!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be nominated by your manager and then approved by the Prez hissself or the VP or someone higher up like that.  Then we have a really nice luncheon on real china and silverware!  wooohoo!!  It actually was really nice.  The food wasn&#39;t the normal slop that usually makes me a little sick.  It actually tasted pretty good.  Even the key lime pie....and I usually don&#39;t like key lime pie.  You get a really cool looking glass plaque trophy thingy and then the VP&#39;s and Prez of banking walk around and sit at the different tables making small talk with ya. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the funniest part was that I had to refer to &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; to remind myself which fork to use.  Other than that, I don&#39;t think I embarrassed myself too much.  The embarrassing part has been my numbers for May and June which have been dismal.  My work goal numbers have been actually pretty good, which is good b/c each week if you did above 90% you get a chance at &quot;The Wheel&quot; which offers all kinds of cool gift cards and such.  I&#39;m getting quite addicted to it.  I&#39;ve gotten a few Visa cards, Walmart cards, movie cards, and a Valero card.  What sucks is in May I got an 81% for my surveys, and this month ain&#39;t looking too good either.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good/bad news is, pretty much everyone is having a really crappy month.  People are walking out faster than they can hire.  What&#39;s really bad is the people they are hiring aren&#39;t going to any VA units (which is only 2 and a half units anyways) and we are just getting slammed.  Last month I closed 41 loans and this month is going over 50! And I am the norm too!  Everyone is getting total burn out.  We are supposed to all be doing conventional by October, and I personally can&#39;t wait!  Unlike the VA, they actually get a quiet fall and winter time period.  And also unlike the VA, they (as in the people from &quot;above&quot;) actually take their discomfort and discord seriously.  Whenever there is a meeting and problems are being discussed, there is always a little asterick next to us which means &quot;Not applicable to VA&quot; and I&#39;m just tired of it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just really do not get paid enough for all the crap I get from borrowers, realtors, and closing agents.  Maybe if I got some kind of commission, like a loan officer gets, it would be worth it.   But all I get is a crappy hourly wage just like any other joe blow and I gotta do all the blowing.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very tired signing out.....</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://beckieskidmarks.blogspot.com/feeds/538115494126969469/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10001603&amp;postID=538115494126969469' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10001603/posts/default/538115494126969469'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10001603/posts/default/538115494126969469'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://beckieskidmarks.blogspot.com/2007/06/hail-to-chief.html' title='Hail to the Chief'/><author><name>Beckie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09760935813783707983</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10001603.post-6670907033746960070</id><published>2007-04-09T22:45:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-04-09T23:00:56.095-05:00</updated><title type='text'>I Hate Bush</title><content type='html'>Hate him Hate him Hate him&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#39;s destroying this country to make money for himself and his friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#39;s selfish, greedy, egotistical, maniacal and ruthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#39;s also stupid and stubborn, which is the only thing that keeps other countries pitying us Americans stuck with such an idiot instead of truly hating us because its us who got suckered into a pack of lies to fund a war to make rich people richer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Show me the money Bush &#39;cause it sure as hell didn&#39;t go to Iraq and its infrastructure and people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History will expose him for what he truly was, the truth is already starting to come out, and everyone will truly know what a lying prick he really was.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, I feel sort of better now.

By summer I need to be firm and toned... being thin with big boobs is not enough.&lt;br /&gt;2) Be on time. &quot;Beckie&quot; time just ain&#39;t cuttin&#39; it and I&#39;m starting to get the feeling I&#39;m turning into a flake.&lt;br /&gt;3) Clean my house more. Neat and tidy is not necessarily clean.&lt;br /&gt;4) Make Processor 1. Not sure why...&lt;br /&gt;5) Pay off my credit card bill. I only have one but the limit would cover few credit card limits for some people, and I need for it to be paid off...so I can buy more stuff...HA!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honor of the New Year I thought I would look at my inner strengths and weaknesses and then expose them to the world....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;middle&quot; bg style=&quot;color:#bfe9ff;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 14pt; COLOR: blackfont-family:Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif;&quot; &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Five Factor Personality Profile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td bgcolor=&quot;#def4ff&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;100&quot; src=&quot;http://images.blogthings.com/thefivefactorpersonalitytest/personality.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extroversion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have low extroversion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are quiet and reserved in most social situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A low key, laid back lifestyle is important to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You tend to bond slowly, over time, with one or two people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conscientiousness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have low conscientiousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impulsive and off the wall, you don&#39;t take life too seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, you sometimes end up regretting your snap decisions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you tend to lack focus, and it&#39;s difficult for you to get important things done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeableness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have medium agreeableness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;re generally a friendly and trusting person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you also have a healthy dose of cynicism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get along well with others, as long as they play fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neuroticism:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have low neuroticism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are very emotionally stable and mentally together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the greatest setbacks upset you, and you bounce back quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you are typically calm and relaxed - making others feel secure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Openness to experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your openness to new experiences is high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In life, you tend to be an early adopter of all new things and ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;ll try almost anything interesting, and you&#39;re constantly pushing your own limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great connoisseir of art and beauty, you can find the positive side of almost anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogthings.com/thefivefactorpersonalitytest/&quot;&gt;The Five Factor Personality Test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#3366ff;&quot;&gt;Happy New Year!!!&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://beckieskidmarks.blogspot.com/feeds/2694414585493367904/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10001603&amp;postID=2694414585493367904' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10001603/posts/default/2694414585493367904'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/10001603/posts/default/2694414585493367904'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://beckieskidmarks.blogspot.com/2007/01/new-years-day.html' title='New Years Day'/><author><name>Beckie</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/09760935813783707983</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
