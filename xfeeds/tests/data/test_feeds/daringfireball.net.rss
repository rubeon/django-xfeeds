Well if the current share price level doesn’t go any higher, in
less than 8 years time someone will be able to pick up the company
effectively for free.</p>

<p>Jack Clark, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google reported profit and sales that topped estimates, lifted by
robust sales of online ads and tighter cost controls, putting
parent Alphabet Inc. on track to overtake Apple Inc. as the
world’s most valuable company.</p>

<p>The results, reported for the first time under a new structure
that separates Google’s main search and advertising operations
from riskier investments, show that fourth-quarter revenue,
excluding sales passed on to partners, rose 19 percent to $17.3
billion. That exceeded analysts’ average projection for $16.9
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, before
certain items, was $8.67 a share, beating the prediction for
$8.08. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>The shares of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet rose as
much as 9.4 percent in extended trading. The stock advanced 1.2
percent to $770.77 at the close in New York, giving the company a
market capitalization of $523.1 billion, compared with $534.7
billion for Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/01/21/largest-companies-by-market-cap">I saw this coming a few weeks ago</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To be clear, Alphabet&#8217;s closing price today left it around $11 billion behind Apple, but their stock is way up in after-hours trading (what Bloomberg calls &#8220;extended trading&#8221;).</p>

<p>Cinephilia and Beyond goes deep on Kubrick&#8217;s <em>Barry Lyndon</em>, one of my very favorites among favorites:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is now considered one of Stanley Kubrick’s most accomplished films, as well as an example of innovative, audacious filmmaking at its best, was almost given birth to by accident. After Kubrick’s dream of making <em>Napoleon</em> crumbled into pieces, he used this studious research and shifted his ambitions and talent into William Makepeace Thackeray’s 1844 novel <em>The Luck of Barry Lyndon</em>. The story of an unscrupulous Irish scoundrel who marries into high society and advances in the aristocratic society of 18th century England proved an ideal ground for the master to exhibit his storytelling powers. With the significant help of his director of photography John Alcott, Kubrick created a cinematic world that could be most easily described as a moving 18th century painting. Giving its best to avoid using electric sources of artificial light, relying on the illuminating power of candles and natural lighting, investing enormous effort into costume design, <em>Barry Lyndon</em> looks genuine through and through. Moreover, it leaves the impression of actually being comprised of works of art taken down from the walls of some filthily rich British nobleman.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Includes links to the (very curiously formatted) screenplay, and American Cinematographer&#8217;s two March 1976 articles on John Alcott&#8217;s photography.</p>

<p>Stephen Hackett, &#8220;The Case Against Control Center&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don&#8217;t think this has aged very well, unfortunately, and it&#8217;s
mostly Control Center&#8217;s fault. In addition to it being confusing
to have a hidden panel at the top of the screen, having one at the
bottom too is a lot to handle for some users. But there&#8217;s a bigger
problem in my mind: Control Center just does way too many things.</p>

<p>I love the top row and screen brightness settings, but as I get
closer to the bottom of the screen, the usefulness of Control
Center lessens. With the exception of maybe the flashlight button,
I&#8217;d be fine if the bottom row went away, Calculator and that
creepy new Night Mode button included.</p>

<p>I think Apple could simplify all of this by looking to Android&#8217;s
Notifications Drawer, where <em>all</em> of this stuff is in one
pull-down tray from the top of the screen. Pull down a little to
see notifications; pull down further to reveal a set of utilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t disagree more strenuously. Control Center is probably my single favorite system-level UI change to iOS ever. I kind of wish you could change the apps hard-coded at the bottom (I&#8217;d replace Calculator with PCalc, for example), but I use it all the time. </p>

<p>I think Notification Center and Today view could still use some improvement. But cramming Control Center into the same pull-down sheet would make things worse, not better. Putting the dynamic Notification Center at the top and the static Control Center at the bottom provides a consistent <em>spatial</em> familiarity. It makes these features feel like they&#8217;re part of the hardware. (And I think Android might have to make them both pull-down-from-the-top because Android phones have soft buttons at the bottom of the display.)</p>

<p>New audio app from Rogue Amoeba:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Suddenly, it&#8217;s easy to pass audio between applications on your
Mac. Create virtual audio devices to take the sound from
applications and audio input devices, then send it to audio
processing applications. Loopback gives you the power of a
high-end studio mixing board, right inside your computer.</p>

<p>This is the sort of app few people need, but for those who need it, it&#8217;s a godsend. I can see a lot of uses for this for screencasters and podcasters.</p>

<p>Steven Johnson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In other words, the tech sector doesn’t have to be the poster
child of inequality’s abuses. It could actually be a role model.
Take just one potential remedy as a thought experiment. Let’s say
we decided as a society that no private company should have a pay
ratio above 40:1. That would lead to a radical decrease in income
inequality, and it wouldn’t involve a cent of additional taxes.
Every private company would be allowed to keep the exact same
portion of its income. The government wouldn’t be extracting money
out of the private sector; it would just put some boundaries on
the way the private sector distributes its money internally.
Critics would scream that such a dramatic intervention would be
terrible for business, but of course the one sector of the economy
that has already voluntarily embraced this ratio turns out to have
nurtured the most profitable corporations in the history of
capitalism. This would no doubt be fiddling with the natural
markets for wages, but we fiddle with these all the time, through
progressive income taxes, earned income tax credits, subsidies,
and tax incentives. We have a minimum wage. What if we had a
maximum ratio?</p>

<p>Paul Thurrott on Windows Phone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s hard to feel good about Windows phone right now: Microsoft
sold just 4.5 million Lumias in the most recent quarter, good for
1.1 percent of the smart phone market. And that’s down from 10.5
million in the same quarter a year ago. It’s even down from the
previous (and non-holiday) quarter, which is … alarming, actually.
This thing has fallen through the floor faster than anyone really
imagined it would.</p>

<p>But it is worth reminding people that Microsoft is simply
following through on its promised strategy of July 2015. Which was
to reduce its exposure to per-unit losses (Microsoft, like Nokia,
loses money on every Lumia) and keep Windows phone in market
artificially, on life support, so that it could continue
developing a cross platform Windows 10 and the universal apps
platform. That is, Windows phone really is dead. But Microsoft
will sell you one if you’re a fan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another sign that the platform is dead: I don&#8217;t see anyone complaining about the lack of apps and developer support any more. It&#8217;s just accepted that Windows Phone doesn&#8217;t have the apps that iOS and Android do.</p>

<p>Rene Ritchie, writing at iMore:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instead of price-dropping the iPhone 6 or coming up with a variant
of that platform, like an iPhone 6c, Apple would simply update the
iPhone 5s. Even with a late 2015 A9 processor, iSight camera
system, and NFC radio for Apple Pay, component costs could still be
kept within Apple&#8217;s target range for price point and margins. That
way, just like the iPod touch refresh last year, people who still
want the iPhone 5s get it, but with specifications that deliver an
updated, modern experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A new 4-inch iPhone with an A9 processor and Touch ID solves a few problems for Apple, in one swoop. It gives Apple a modern iPhone to sell to people who really do prefer the smaller size, and it gives them a low-end-of-the-lineup model that is technically relevant for another 18-24 months.</p>

considered applying to several of the big tech companies and
immediately crossed Apple off his list.</p>

<p>“Apple’s culture is one that’s so negative, so strict, so harsh,”
said Knight, a talented 27-year-old coder who left a job at Google
for more lucrative freelance work. “At Apple, you’re gonna be
working 60-80 hours a week and some VP will come yell at you at
any moment? That’s a very hostile work environment.” [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Knight says he and many of his friends value lifestyle over
salary. “I’m the kind of person who likes to show up to work
sometimes at 11, or maybe work from home one day. And Apple’s not
the place you can do that,” Knight said. “Apple can move away from
that culture but culture takes time. A lot of time. And stock
prices drop hourly.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve been saying <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/02/08/retention-of-talent">for a while now</a> that recruiting and talent retention are the single biggest problem Apple faces. But my take on it is subtle. Apple is driven by A-team talent, and A-team talent is in high demand across the whole industry. And as Guy English has pointed out, it&#8217;s a lot less exciting to be working on the tenth-generation iPhone than the first-generation of something new. The other problem Apple faces is that it&#8217;s not just <em>any</em> A-team talent that Apple needs, Apple needs A-team talent that <em>understands and appreciates Apple&#8217;s design-focused culture</em>.</p>

<p>That said, this Guardian piece by Bowles seems to be trying to argue that Apple is having trouble hiring anyone, period. That sounds like nonsense to me. And this James Knight guy sounds more like someone who Apple wouldn&#8217;t want to hire in the first place than someone who Apple covets but can&#8217;t get.</p>

  <p>Henson made 179 ten-second spots for Wilkins Coffee, a regional
company with distribution in the Baltimore-Washington D.C. market,
according to the Muppets Wiki: “The local stations only had ten
seconds for station identification, so the Muppet commercials had
to be lightning-fast–essentially, eight seconds for the commercial
pitch and a two-second shot of the product.”</p>

<p>Within those eight seconds, a coffee enthusiast named Wilkins (who
bears a resemblance to Kermit the Frog) manages to shoot, stab,
bludgeon or otherwise do grave bodily harm to a coffee holdout

Windows on phones might become a thing with Continuum eventually,

<p>Walt Mossberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But, underneath all that, Twitter&#8217;s fundamental problem is this:
it&#8217;s too hard to use.</p>

<p>To potential new users, it&#8217;s a real challenge to learn all of
Twitter&#8217;s often arcane little features. And even for people who
have been using the service multiple times daily for years, like
me, it can be tricky to decide when to use which feature and in
which situation. For instance, new users might be confused about
what a retweet is, or the difference between that and a &#8220;quote
tweet&#8221; (where you say more about something you&#8217;re reposting). And
they surely might not understand the need to place a period before
the handle of a user, when that handle is at the very start of a
tweet you compose, yet not elsewhere in the tweet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do think Twitter has become far too complicated. The original appeal of Twitter was largely based on its simplicity. But I have argued for years that the fundamental problem is <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/05/06/twitter-oremus">that Twitter is compared to Facebook</a>, and it shouldn&#8217;t be. Facebook appeals to billions of people. &#8220;Most people&#8221;, it&#8217;s fair to say. Twitter appeals to hundreds of millions of people. That&#8217;s amazing, and there&#8217;s tremendous value in that &#8212; but it&#8217;s no Facebook. Cramming extra features into Twitter will never make it as popular as Facebook &#8212; it will only dilute what it is that makes Twitter as popular and useful as it is.</p>

<p>Google researchers David Silver and Demis Hassabis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So how strong is AlphaGo? To answer this question, we played a
tournament between AlphaGo and the best of the rest - the top Go
programs at the forefront of A.I. research. Using a single
machine, AlphaGo won all but one of its 500 games against these
programs. In fact, AlphaGo even beat those programs after giving
them 4 free moves headstart at the beginning of each game. A
high-performance version of AlphaGo, distributed across many
machines, was even stronger.</p>

<p>It seemed that AlphaGo was ready for a greater challenge. So we
invited the reigning 3-time European Go champion Fan Hui &#8212; an
elite professional player who has devoted his life to Go since the
age of 12 &#8212; to our London office for a challenge match. The match
was played behind closed doors between October 5-9 last year.
AlphaGo won by 5 games to 0 &#8212; the first time a computer program
has ever beaten a professional Go player.</p>

<p>Ken Case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At this time last year, we had four shipping apps on iPad &#8212;
OmniFocus, OmniGraffle, OmniOutliner, and OmniPlan &#8212; but just one
of those apps was available on iPhone. Apple had just shipped the
iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and with their larger screens we decided to
bring all our apps to iPhone. And we did just that, shipping free
universal updates to the iPad apps that made them also run on
iPhone: first OmniGraffle on March 5, then OmniPlan on March 12,
OmniOutliner on March 19, and finally OmniFocus on April 2.
(OmniFocus was actually ready on April 1, but if we shipped it
that day I worried that people might think the whole thing was an
April Fools’ joke!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among long-time Mac developers, I think the Omni Group is doing as good a job as anyone at making iOS development a thriving part of their business.</p>

<p>Up next, some cool news for OmniOutliner:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For OmniOutliner, I’m very pleased to share that we have some
major writing improvements on the way! On both Mac and iOS, we
plan to support distraction-free full-screen editing, the ability
to see your current word count, and support for directly editing
Markdown documents.</p>

  <p>iOS Revenue. I brought this up last year and we still haven’t
licked it. We had a change of heart &#8212; well, an experimental
change of heart &#8212; and <em>reduced</em> the price of our iOS apps in 2015
to normalize them at $9.99 or less, thinking that was the upper
limit and/or sweet spot for iOS app pricing. But it didn’t have a
meaningful impact on sales.</p>

<p>More and more I’m beginning to think we simply made the wrong type
of apps for iOS &#8212; we made professional tools that aren’t really
“in demand” on that platform &#8212; and that price isn’t our problem,
but interest is.</p>

<p>So, once again, we will investigate <em>raising</em> our iOS app prices
in 2016, with two hopes: that the awesome customers that love and
need these apps understand the incredible amount of work that
goes into them and that these people are also willing to pay more
for a quality professional app (whereas, say, the casual gamer
would not).</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/linked/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>Tim Cook on Apple&#8217;s record-breaking quarter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you very much for joining us.
Today, we&#8217;re reporting Apple&#8217;s strongest financial results ever.
We generated all-time record quarterly revenue of 75.9 billion
dollars in the December quarter, in line with our expectations,
and have 2 percent over last year&#8217;s blockbuster results.</p>

<p>This is a huge accomplishment for our company, especially given
the turbulent world around us. In constant currency, our growth
rate would have been 8 percent. Our record revenue and continued
strong operating performance also led to an all-time record
quarterly net income of 18.4 billion dollars. We sold 74.8 million
iPhones in the December quarter, an all-time high. To put that
volume into perspective, it&#8217;s an average of over 34,000 iPhones an
hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 13 straight weeks.
It&#8217;s almost 50 percent more than our Q1 volume just two years ago,
and more than four times our volume five years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The big news, though, is that Apple&#8217;s forecast for this quarter has iPhone sales dipping year-over-year for the first time ever. Here&#8217;s why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We see that Q2 is the toughest compare. We believe it&#8217;s the
toughest compare because the year-ago quarter also had catchup in
it from Q1; if you recall, we were heavily supply-constrained
throughout the whole of Q1, and so some of that demand moved into
Q2. Plus, we&#8217;re in an environment now that is dramatically
different from a macroeconomic point of view than last Q2: from a
currency point of view, from the level at which we&#8217;ve had to
adjust pricing in several of these markets, and sort of the
overall malaise in virtually every country in the world. It&#8217;s
really all of those factors that play in there, and it&#8217;s difficult
to sort out how much is due to which one.</p>

<p>Hillel Italie, reporting for the AP:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Character Abe Vigoda, whose leathery, sunken-eyed face made him
ideal for playing the over-the-hill detective Phil Fish in the
1970s TV series &#8220;Barney Miller&#8221; and the doomed Mafia soldier in
&#8220;The Godfather,&#8221; died Tuesday at age 94.</p>

<p>Vigoda&#8217;s daughter, Carol Vigoda Fuchs, told The Associated Press
that Vigoda died Tuesday morning in his sleep at Fuchs&#8217; home in
Woodland Park, New Jersey. The cause of death was old age. &#8220;This
man was never sick,&#8221; Fuchs said.</p>

<p>The Onion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Situated between Epcot and the Magic Kingdom, the 350-acre
property reportedly incorporates many of the most aggravating
elements of Disney’s other parks and expands them into a creative
and fully immersive world of irritation, which is said to include
the longest lines in the entire resort, a convoluted layout that
is only depicted in indecipherable cartoon maps that are not to
scale, and 150 percent higher prices. According to park director
Jacob Bartlett, Ordeal Kingdom’s specialized combination of
features will ensure a slowly building resentment among visiting
families, eventually resulting in a dramatic public outburst
followed by a silent walk back to the car.</p>

<p>“We’ve considered every detail to ensure parents and their kids
have the heated argument of a lifetime,” said Bartlett, explaining
that the park was split into five themed “lands,” including
Fatigue Island and Hunger Lagoon, each of which can be reached by
Mickey’s Congestion Junction Railway. “Whether it’s the sheer
distance between rides or the unspecified bathroom locations,
every aspect of the experience is guaranteed to ratchet up the
tension until you and your family are screaming at each other and
saying you should never have come in the first place.”</p>

<p>Steven Musil, CNet:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microsoft&#8217;s tablet seemed to suffer another public black eye
Sunday as TV viewers of the AFC championship game Sunday between
the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots were told that the
tablets on the Patriots&#8217; sidelines had failed.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re having some trouble with their Microsoft Surface
tablets,&#8221; CBS&#8217; sideline reporter Evan Washburn reported during the
game. &#8220;On the last defensive possession the Patriots&#8217; coaches did
not have access to those tablets to show pictures to their
players. NFL officials have been working at it. Some of those
tablets are back in use, but not all of them. A lot of frustration
that they didn&#8217;t have them on that last possession.&#8221;</p>

<p>The outage, which struck during the first half, was brief, and the
Patriots&#8217; tablets were soon restored to working order. A Microsoft
spokesman blamed the problem on a network connectivity issue
rather than a tablet malfunction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No tablet is going to work if the network is down, but this shows the risks of paid product placement in a live arena.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pinch to zoom implementation on Android has always been quite
poor, with the zooming not tracking well with the user&#8217;s actual
pinching motion. In this case, the problem is also that the zoom
animation just has an incredibly low frame rate at times, to the
point where it&#8217;s like watching a slide show. It’s honestly
shocking to see these issues on a device designed by Google

<p>Dave Winer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If Medium were more humble, or if they had competition, I would
relax about it. But I remember how much RSS suffered for being
dominated by Google. And Google was a huge company and could have
afforded to run Google Reader forever at a loss. Medium is a
startup, a well-funded one for sure, but they could easily pivot
and leave all the stories poorly served, or not served at all. I&#8217;m
sure their user license doesn&#8217;t require them to store your writing
perpetually, or even until next week.</p>

<p>I only want to point to things that I think have a chance at
existing years from now. And things that are reasonably
unconflicted, where I feel I understand where the author is coming
from. Neither of those criteria are met by posts on Medium. I also
want to preserve the ability of developers to innovate in this
area. If Medium sews up this media type, if they own it for all
practical purposes, as Google owned RSS (until they dropped it),
then you can&#8217;t move until they do. And companies with monopolies
have no incentive to move forward, and therefore rarely do. Look
at how slowly Twitter has improved their platform, and all the new
features are for advertisers, not for writers. I suspect Medium
will go down a similar path.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The comparison to Google Reader is perfect. Google Reader was both (a) the most popular thing that ever happened to RSS, and (b) the worst thing that ever happened to RSS.</p>

<p>Mark Gurman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new device is internally codenamed “N69,” but the launch name
will likely be the “iPhone 5se.” The “se” suffix has been
described in two ways by Apple employees: as a “special edition”
variation of the vintage 4-inch iPhone screen size and as an
“enhanced” version of the iPhone 5s.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why not &#8220;iPhone 5se/30&#8221;?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, the upcoming “5se” features a design similar to 2013’s
flagship but upgraded internals, software, and hardware features
that blend the old design with modern technologies from the past
two iPhone upgrades.</p>

<p>Sources have provided the following list of “iPhone 5se” upgrades
over the 5s:</p>

<ul>
<li>The chamfered, shiny edges have been replaced with curved glass
like on the iPhone 6 and 6s lines.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t see how curved glass fits with the iPhone 5 industrial design. And what about the chamfered edges on the back? </p>

<p>Joel Rosenblatt and Adam Satariano, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple received $1 billion from its rival in 2014, according to a
transcript of court proceedings from Oracle Corp.’s copyright
lawsuit against Google. The search engine giant has an agreement
with Apple that gives the iPhone maker a percentage of the revenue
Google generates through the Apple device, an attorney for Oracle
said at a Jan. 14 hearing in federal court. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Annette Hurst, the Oracle attorney who disclosed details of the
Google-Apple agreement at last week’s court hearing, said a Google
witness questioned during pretrial information said that “at one
point in time the revenue share was 34 percent.” It wasn’t clear
from the transcript whether that percentage is the amount of
revenue kept by Google or paid to Apple.</p>

<p>An attorney for Google objected to the information being disclosed
and attempted to have the judge strike the mention of 34 percent
from the record.</p>

<p>“That percentage just stated, that should be sealed,” lawyer
Robert Van Nest said, according to the transcript. “We are talking
hypotheticals here. That’s not a publicly known number.”</p>

<p>The magistrate judge presiding over the hearing later refused
Google’s request to block the sensitive information in the
transcript from public review. Google then asked Alsup to seal and
redact the transcript, saying the disclosure could severely affect
its ability to negotiate similar agreements with other companies.
Apple joined Google’s request in a separate filing.</p>

<p>“The specific financial terms of Google’s agreement with Apple are
highly sensitive to both Google and Apple,” Google said in its
Jan. 20 filing. “Both Apple and Google have always treated this
information as extremely confidential.”</p>

<p>The transcript vanished without a trace from electronic court
records at about 3 p.m. Pacific standard time with no indication
that the court ruled on Google’s request to seal it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fascinating. If it&#8217;s a revenue share agreement (as opposed to a flat sum), I wonder how Apple verifies the numbers?</p>

<p>Everyone knows Google pays Apple for this placement, but now that we have an actual figure (and no reason to believe it&#8217;s gone down since 2014), how does this square with Tim Cook&#8217;s criticism of Google&#8217;s targeted advertising business model as an invasion of privacy?</p>

<p>New York Times report from August:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The National Security Agency’s ability to spy on vast quantities
of Internet traffic passing through the United States has relied
on its extraordinary, decades-long partnership with a single
company: the telecom giant AT&amp;T.</p>

<p>While it has been long known that American telecommunications
companies worked closely with the spy agency, newly disclosed
N.S.A. documents show that the relationship with AT&amp;T has been
considered unique and especially productive. One document
described it as “highly collaborative,” while another lauded the
company’s “extreme willingness to help.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, from the company whose CEO now says “I don’t think it is Silicon Valley’s decision to make about whether encryption is the right thing to do.”</p>

<p>Because of companies like AT&amp;T and craven leaders like Randall Stephenson, it is now very clear that end-to-end strong encryption is of course the &#8220;right thing to do&#8221;.</p>

<p>Jon Brodkin, writing for Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But tech company leaders aren’t all joining the fight against the
deliberate weakening of encryption. AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson
said this week that AT&amp;T, Apple, and other tech companies
shouldn’t have any say in the debate.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is Silicon Valley’s decision to make about
whether encryption is the right thing to do,” Stephenson said in
an <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-ceo-says-congress-should-determine-encryption-policy-not-companies-1453294093">interview</a> with The Wall Street Journal. “I understand
[Apple CEO] Tim Cook’s decision, but I don’t think it’s his
decision to make.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, given the law as it stands today, it <em>is</em> Apple&#8217;s decision to make.</p>

<p>Clay Johnson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you know that when this president took office, it was illegal
for the President to end a tweet with a question mark without a
six month approval process from the economists across the street
at the “Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.” No
seriously &#8212; they seriously had to give guidance to the rest of
the federal agencies in 2009 that gave them permission to ask
questions over the internet. It basically says: Sure, you can ask
people questions, as long as you don’t ask for structured
feedback (feedback you can do anything with). Thus it became OK
to end sentences on twitter with a question mark. I can’t make
this stuff up!</p>

<p>The Paperwork Reduction Act is a terrible law. It doesn’t need to
be revisited or revamped. It needs to be removed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Johnson concludes, repealing this law ought to get bipartisan support.</p>

<p>Miguel Helft, writing for Forbes on Oracle&#8217;s claim that Google has generated only $31 billion in cumulative revenue from Android:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, and the comparisons between Google’s Android business and
Apple’s iOS business that are starting to surface (Apple generated
$32.2 billion in iPhone sales in the most recent <em>quarter</em>), well,
they don’t mean much either. Apple sells mostly hardware. Google
sells mostly ads. Those are fundamentally different businesses.
Both companies are very successful at what they do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s all true, but it highlights the fundamental difference between the PC and mobile eras. In the PC era, Microsoft generated more revenue and far more profit than any hardware company, including Apple.</p>

<p><a href="http://recode.net/2016/01/19/how-donald-trump-got-everything-wrong-about-apple-in-one-sentence/">Arik Hesseldahl, writing for Recode</a> on Donald Trump&#8217;s &#8220;we’re gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries&#8221; campaign promise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Any honest presidential candidate regardless of party should say
clearly and indeed proudly that America doesn’t want these jobs to
come back. Final assembly jobs are low-skilled, low-paying
occupations; no American would wish to support a family on what
the jobs would pay. Workers at China’s Foxconn, which
manufacturers the iPhone, make about $402 per month after three
months of on-the-job probation. Even at the lowest minimum wage in
the U.S. &#8212; $5.15 an hour in Wyoming &#8212; American workers can’t
beat that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s not that simple. These jobs are certainly menial, but they&#8217;re not low-skill. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/60-minutes-apple-tim-cook-charlie-rose/">As Tim Cook said on 60 Minutes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Charlie Rose: So if it&#8217;s not wages, what is it?</p>

<p>Tim Cook: It&#8217;s skill. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Charlie Rose: They have more skills than American workers? They
have more skills than &#8212;</p>

<p>Tim Cook: Now &#8212; now, hold on.</p>

<p>Charlie Rose: &#8212; German workers?</p>

<p>Tim Cook: Yeah, let me &#8212; let me &#8212; let me clear, China put an
enormous focus on manufacturing. In what we would call, you and I
would call vocational kind of skills. The U.S., over time, began
to stop having as many vocational kind of skills. I mean, you can
take every tool and die maker in the United States and probably
put them in a room that we&#8217;re currently sitting in. In China, you
would have to have multiple football fields.</p>

<p>Charlie Rose: Because they&#8217;ve taught those skills in their
schools?</p>

<p>Tim Cook: It&#8217;s because it was a focus of them &#8212; it&#8217;s a focus of
their educational system. And so that is the reality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wages are a huge factor, but for the sake of argument, let&#8217;s say Apple was willing to dip into its massive cash reserves and pay assembly line workers in the U.S. a good wage. Where would these U.S.-made iPhone be assembled? A year ago <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/01/27Apple-Reports-Record-First-Quarter-Results.html">Apple sold 75 million iPhones in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014</a>. There is no facility in the U.S. that can do that. There might not be anywhere in the world <em>other than China</em> that can operate at that sort of scale. That&#8217;s almost one million iPhones per day. 10 iPhones <em>per second</em>. Think about that.</p>

<p>You can say, well, Apple could dig even deeper into its coffers and build such facilities. And train tens of thousands of employees. But why would they? Part of the marvel of Apple&#8217;s operations is that they can assemble and sell an unfathomable number of devices but they&#8217;re not on the hook for the assembly plants and facilities. When iPhones go the way of the iPod in 10 or 15 or 20 years, Apple doesn&#8217;t have any factories to close or convert for other uses. Foxconn does.</p>

<p>The U.S. can&#8217;t compete with China on wages. It can&#8217;t compete on the size of the labor force. China has had a decades-long push in its education system to train these workers; the U.S. has not. And the U.S. doesn&#8217;t have the facilities or the proximity to the Asian component manufacturers.</p>

<p>The only way Apple could ever switch to U.S. assembly and manufacturing would be if they automated the entire process &#8212; to build machines that build the machines. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSj6kvv7_Sg">That, in fact, is what NeXT did while they were in the hardware business</a>. But NeXT only ever sold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT">about 50,000 computers total</a>. Apple needed to assemble 35,000 iPhones per <em>hour</em> last year.</p>

<p>So long as assembling these devices remains labor intensive, it has to happen in China. And if someday it becomes automated &#8212; if the machines are built by machines &#8212; by definition it&#8217;s not going to create manufacturing jobs.<sup id="fnr1-2016-01-20"><a href="#fn1-2016-01-20">1</a></sup></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1-2016-01-20">
<p>I do wonder about the purported Apple car. Would that be assembled in China, too? The U.S. does have automobile manufacturing expertise. And a car is so utterly unlike any product Apple has ever made that I feel like anything is possible.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2016-01-20"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Regarding Apple&#8217;s new Smart Battery Case for the iPhone 6/6S.</p>
]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-smart-battery-case-review-iphone-battery-life-nearly-doubled-1449581402?mod=ST1">Joanna Stern tested Apple&#8217;s new Smart Battery Case for five days, and likes it a lot</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s get this out of the way: The bar for battery-case design is
extremely low. Most are chunky and made of black matte plastic,
requiring you to attach two pieces to your phone. You choose a
battery case for utility, not fashion.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s Smart Battery Case, though still fairly unsightly, is
ahead of those. Bend back the top and slide in your phone. It
feels just like Apple’s smooth, soft-touch wraparound silicone
case, except… with a protruding, awkward battery on the back. The
battery juts out as if your phone will soon give birth to a
rectangular alien.</p>

<p>Still, I’ll take it over all the ugly messes sold by Mophie,
Anker and others, especially since it provides better protection
for the phone. A lip curves just above the screen to prevent the
glass from hitting a hard surface and an interior lining provides
better shock absorption than hard plastic. Plus, the grippy
material is much easier to hold and doesn’t feel like it will
slip from my hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9867996/apple-smart-battery-case-iphone-6-6s-hands-on">The Verge&#8217;s Lauren Goode disagrees</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple’s smart battery case is fine, then, if you want a softer
case or a &#8220;passive&#8221; battery charging experience, with zero control
over or understanding of how the case actually charges your phone.
Maybe that’s what Apple is hoping: that buyers of this thing will
slip it on and never take it off, charging their iPhones entirely
through the case’s Lightning port going forward, forgetting about
its big ol’ bump in the back. They will be pleased, finally, with
their iPhone 6’s or 6S’s battery life, and the memory of spending
an extra $99 for it, rather than having it just work that way in
the first place, will eventually fade away.</p>

<p>It’s fine if you don’t want exterior indicator lights, or a even a
case that gives you a 0 to 100 percent charge. After all, this one
was designed <em>for the iPhone</em>, by the same company that <em>made your
iPhone</em>. For some people, that’s a big draw.</p>

<p>In either case this will probably sell like hot cakes. It fits
nicely in holiday stockings. ’Tis the season. Just know that from
a pure performance and even a design perspective, Apple’s effort
is not the best you can get.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I can almost see her eyes rolling as she typed those italicized words in the second quoted paragraph.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siTDA-n1hFg">Lewis Hilsenteger of Unbox Therapy best captured</a> what most of us thought when we first saw it: &#8220;These things look weird.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was certainly my first impression when I got mine Tuesday morning. The looks-like-it&#8217;s-pregnant-with-an-iPod-Touch design is certainly curious. I think to understand why it looks like this we have to ask why it even exists:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People who use their phones heavily &#8212; <em>power users</em>, if you will &#8212; struggle to get through a day on a single charge with the iPhone 6/6S.</p></li>
<li><p>The Plus models offer so much more battery life that getting through the day on a single charge isn&#8217;t a problem, even for power users who are on their phones all day long. But most people don&#8217;t want an iPhone that large.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple has long sold <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/iphone/iphone-accessories/cases-protection?page=1#!&amp;f=batterycase&amp;fh=458b%2B45bf">third-party battery cases in its stores</a>, so they know how popular they are.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing battery cases all suffer from similar design problems, as outlined by Joanna Stern above. They make the entire device look and feel chunky, and most of them are built from materials that don&#8217;t feel good. None of them integrate in any way with the software on the iPhone, and most of them use micro USB instead of Lightning for charging the case.</p></li>
<li><p>Lastly, Apple claims the Smart Battery Case tackles a problem I wasn&#8217;t aware existed: that existing battery cases adversely affect cellular reception because they&#8217;re putting a battery between the phone&#8217;s antenna and the exterior of the case.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I think Apple&#8217;s priorities for the Smart Battery Case were as follows &#8212; and the order matters:</p>

<ol>
<li>Provides effective battery life equivalent to the iPhone 6S Plus.</li>
<li>Feels good in your hand.</li>
<li>Makes it easy and elegant to insert and remove the phone.</li>
<li>Works as a durable protective case.</li>
<li>Prevents the case&#8217;s battery from affecting cellular reception.</li>
<li>Looks good.</li>
</ol>

<p>That &#8220;looks good&#8221; is last on the list is unusual for an Apple product, to say the least. Looking good isn&#8217;t always first on Apple&#8217;s list of priorities, but it&#8217;s seldom far from the top. But in this case it makes sense: Apple sells great-looking silicone and leather cases for people who aren&#8217;t looking for a battery case, and all existing third-party battery cases are clunky in some way.</p>

<p>Ungainly though the case&#8217;s hump is, I can&#8217;t help but suspect one reason for it might be, counterintuitively, a certain vanity on the part of its designers. Not for the sake of the case itself, but for the iPhone. Third-party &#8220;thick from top to bottom&#8221; battery cases make it impossible to tell whether the enclosed phone is itself thick or thin. Apple&#8217;s Smart Battery Case makes it obvious that it&#8217;s a thin iPhone in a case which has a thick battery on the back. And I&#8217;ll say this for Apple: they are <em>owning</em> that hump. The hero photo of the case on the packaging is a face-on view of the back of the case.</p>

<p>But I think the main reasons for this design are practical. The battery doesn&#8217;t extend to the top in order to accommodate the hinge design for inserting and removing the phone. Why it doesn&#8217;t extend to the bottom is a little less obvious. I suspect one reason is that that&#8217;s where the &#8220;passively coupling antenna&#8221; is.<sup id="fnr1-2015-12-11"><a href="#fn1-2015-12-11">1</a></sup> Extending the battery to cover it would defeat the purpose. Also, there&#8217;s a hand feel aspect to it &#8212; normally I rest the bottom of my iPhone on my pinky finger. With this case, I can rest the bottom ridge of the hump on my pinky, and it&#8217;s kind of nice. I also like putting my index finger atop the hump.</p>

<p>So the Smart Battery Case <em>looks</em> weird. Typical battery cases look fat. Whether you prefer the weird look of the Smart Battery Case to the fat look of a typical case is subjective. Me, I don&#8217;t like the way any of them look. But after using the Smart Battery Case for three days, and having previously spent time using the thinnest available cases from Mophie, I feel confident saying Apple&#8217;s Smart Battery Case <em>feels better</em> when you&#8217;re holding it than any other battery case, both because of the material and its shape. It&#8217;s not even a close call. It also feels sturdier &#8212; this is the most protective iPhone case Apple has ever made, with rigid reinforced sides and a slightly higher lip rising above the touchscreen. The Smart Battery Case also clearly <em>looks</em> better from your own face-on perspective when using the phone. (Mophie&#8217;s cases look better than most, but they emboss an obnoxious &#8220;mophie&#8221; logotype on the front-facing chin. If Apple doesn&#8217;t print anything on the front face of the iPhone, why in the world would a case maker?)</p>

<p>Patents, by the way, are a non-issue regarding the Smart Battery Case&#8217;s design. A well-placed little birdie who is perched in a position to know told me that <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872238/is-apples-smart-battery-case-mophie-patents">Nilay Patel&#8217;s speculation</a> that the unusual design was the byproduct of Apple trying to steer clear of patents held by Mophie (or any other company for that matter) are &#8220;absolute nonsense&#8221;. This birdie was unequivocal on the matter. Whether you like it, hate it, or are ambivalent about it, this is the battery case Apple wanted to make.</p>

<p>My take is that the Smart Battery Case is an inelegant design, but it is solving a problem for which, to date, <em>no one</em> has created an elegant solution. Apple has simply chosen to make different severe trade-offs than the existing competition. In that sense, it is a very Apple-like product &#8212; like the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hockey+puck+apple+mouse&amp;t=osx&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images">hockey-puck mouse</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G4">iMac G4</a>.</p>

<h2>On Capacity, Simplicity, and the Intended Use Case</h2>

<p>Most battery cases have an on/off toggle switch, controlling when the case is actually charging the phone. The reason for this is that you can squeeze more from a battery case if you only charge the phone when it&#8217;s mostly depleted. Here&#8217;s a passage from <a href="http://www.mophie.com/frequent-questions">Mophie&#8217;s FAQ page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When should I turn on my mophie case?</em></p>

<p>To get the most charge out of your case, turn it on around 10%-20%
and keep the case charging without using it until your iPhone hits
80% battery life. From there, you can either wait until it gets
low again or top it off when the battery is less than 80%. Apple’s
batteries fast-charge to 80%, then switch to trickle charging for
the last 20%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simplicity is a higher priority for Apple than fiddly control. If a peripheral can get by without an on/off switch, Apple is going to omit the switch. (Exhibit B: Apple Pencil.) The whole point of the Smart Battery Case is that you charge it up and put your iPhone in it and that&#8217;s it. Complaining about the lack of an on/off toggle or external charge capacity indicator lights on the Smart Battery Case reminds me of the complaints about the original iPhone omitting the then-ubiquitous green/red hardware buttons for starting and ending phone calls. Sure, there was a purpose to them, but in the end the simplification was worth it. If your iPhone is in the case, it&#8217;s charging. That&#8217;s it.</p>

<p>Regarding the battery capacity of the case, here&#8217;s Lauren Goode, author of the aforelinked review for The Verge, <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenGoode/status/674256583589662720">on Twitter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A quick comparison for you: $99 Apple Battery Case 1877 mAh,
$100 Mophie Juice Pack Air 2750 mAh, $50 Incipio Offgrid Express
3000 mAh</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nothing could better encapsulate the wrong way of looking at the Smart Battery Case than this tweet. The intended use of the Smart Battery Case is to allow prolonged, heavy use of an iPhone 6/6S throughout one day. In my testing, and judging by the reviews of others, its 1,877 mAh battery is enough for that. Adding a bigger battery would have just made it even heavier and more ungainly.</p>

<p>And the very name of the Incipio <em>Offgrid</em> Express suggests that it is intended for an entirely different use case: traveling away from power for more than a day.</p>

<p>Which in turn brings me to <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/12/09/tim-cook-iphone-smart-battery-case-hump/">Tim Cook&#8217;s comments to Mashable&#8217;s Lance Ulanoff yesterday</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some also see the introduction of an Apple battery case as an
admission that battery life on the iPhone 6 and 6s isn’t all it
should be.</p>

<p>Cook, though, said that “if you’re charging your phone every day,
you probably don’t need this at all. But if you’re out hiking and
you go on overnight trips… it’s kind of nice to have.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Smart Battery Case would certainly help with an overnight hiking trip, but I think Cook was off-message here, because that scenario is really not what it was designed for. Big 5,000 mAh (or more) external battery chargers (or the highest capacity, extremely thick battery cases from third parties) are far better suited to that scenario than the Smart Battery Case. But Ulanoff&#8217;s preceding paragraph points to the marketing predicament inherent in a first-party Apple battery case: that it implies the built-in battery of the iPhone 6S is insufficient.</p>

<p>The clear lesson is that it&#8217;s far better to give a phone more battery life by making the phone itself thicker and including a correspondingly thicker (and thus bigger) internal battery than by using any sort of external battery. After a few days using this case, my thoughts turn not to the Smart Battery Case itself but instead to my <em>personal</em> desire that Apple had made the 6/6S form factor slightly thicker. Not a <em>lot</em> thicker. Just a little &#8212; just enough to boost battery life around 15-20 percent or so.<sup id="fnr2-2015-12-11"><a href="#fn2-2015-12-11">2</a></sup> That wouldn&#8217;t completely alleviate the need for external batteries. But it would eliminate a lot of <em>my</em> need &#8212; my phone dies only a few times a year, but when it does, it almost invariably happens very late at night.</p>

<p>I emphasized the word &#8220;<em>personal</em>&#8221; in the preceding paragraph because I realize my needs and desires are not representative of the majority. I think the battery life of the iPhone 6S as-is is sufficient for the vast majority of typical users. I suspect Cook went with the overnight hiking scenario specifically to avoid the implication that the built-in battery is insufficient. But the better explanation is that the built-in battery is insufficient for power users who use their iPhones far more than most people do.</p>

<h2>My Advice</h2>

<p>If you find yourself short on battery with your iPhone every day (or even most days), and you can&#8217;t make an adjustment to, say, put a charging dock on your desk or in your car to give your iPhone&#8217;s internal battery a periodic snack, then you should probably bite the bullet and switch to a 6S Plus. However bulky the Plus feels in your pocket and hands, it feels <em>less</em> bulky to me than the iPhone 6S with <em>any</em> battery pack. An iPhone 6S Plus, even with a normal case on it, weighs noticeably less than an iPhone 6S with the Smart Battery Case. If you need the extra battery capacity every day, you might as well get the Plus. (If you actually prefer the bigger Plus to the 4.7-inch devices, you&#8217;re in luck &#8212; you get the screen size you prefer, <em>and</em> a significantly longer-lasting battery. My advice here is for those who prefer the 4.7-inch size, other considerations aside.)</p>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t describe me, however. On a typical day, my iPhone 6S seldom drops below 20 percent by the time I go to sleep. But when I&#8217;m traveling, I often need a portable battery of some sort. Cellular coverage can be spotty (which drains the battery), and when I&#8217;m away from home, I tend to do more (or even the entirety) of my daily computing on the iPhone. Conferences, in particular, can be dreadful on battery life. At WWDC my iPhone can drop to 50 percent by the time the keynote is over Monday morning.</p>

<p>In recent years, rather than use a battery case, I&#8217;ve switched to carrying a portable external battery. My favorite for the past year or so is <a href="http://www.mophie.com/shop/universal-batteries/powerstation-plus-2X">the $80 Mophie Powerstation Plus 2X</a>. It&#8217;s relatively small, packs a 3,000 mAh capacity, and has built-in USB and Lightning cables. At conferences or for work travel, it&#8217;s easily stashed in my laptop bag, so my pockets aren&#8217;t weighed down at all, and my iPhone isn&#8217;t saddled with an unnatural case. If I do need to carry it in my pocket, it&#8217;s not too bad. It&#8217;s also easier to share with friends or family than a battery case. At night, I just plug the Powerstation into an AC adapter, and my iPhone into the Powerstation, and both devices get charged &#8212; no need for a separate charger or any additional cables.</p>

<p>The big advantage to using a battery case instead of an external battery pack is that you can easily keep using your phone while it charges. That&#8217;s awkward, at best, while your phone is tethered by a cable to a small brick.</p>

<p>If I were going to go back to using a battery case, there&#8217;s no question in my mind that I&#8217;d go with Apple&#8217;s. The only downside to it compared to Mophie&#8217;s (and the others &#8212; but I think Mophie is clearly the leader of the pack) is that it looks funny from the back. But to my eyes it doesn&#8217;t look <em>that</em> funny, and though third-party cases don&#8217;t look <em>weird</em>, they don&#8217;t look (or feel) <em>good</em>. In every other way, Apple&#8217;s Smart Battery Case wins: it&#8217;s all Lightning, so any Lightning peripherals you have will work, and there&#8217;s no need to pack a grody micro USB cable; it supplies more than enough additional power to get you through an active day; its unibody design makes it much easier to insert and remove the phone; and it feels much better in hand.</p>

<li id="fn1-2015-12-11">
<p>My understanding of how this &#8220;passively assistive antenna&#8221; works is that it takes the cellular signal and amplifies it as it passes through the case in a way that makes it easier for the iPhone&#8217;s antenna to &#8220;hear&#8221;. Sort of like the antenna equivalent of cupping your hand around your ear. I have no idea whether this is legit, or some sort of placebo marketing bullshit, but it would be interesting to see someone measure the cellular reception of (a) a naked iPhone 6S, (b) the same iPhone in a, say, Mophie battery case, and (c) the same iPhone in the Smart Battery Case.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2015-12-11"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

]]></summary>
	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>This piece by Bryan Clark for TheNextWeb caught my eye last weekend &#8212; &#8220;<a href="http://thenextweb.com/opinion/2015/11/07/weve-reached-maybe-passed-peak-apple-why-the-narrative-needs-to-change/">We’ve Reached &#8212; Maybe Passed &#8212; Peak Apple: Why the Narrative Needs to Change</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last month, Apple’s latest earnings call announced its “most
successful year ever.” The numbers were reported, the stories
were spun and Wall Street basically anointed Apple the god of
capitalism.</p>

<p>They’re all wrong.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple wasn&#8217;t wrong &#8212; fiscal 2015 was Apple&#8217;s most successful year ever, by the objective measures of both revenue and profit. I suppose you can decide to define &#8220;most successful year ever&#8221; in terms of something else, like percentage growth or stock price gains, but revenue and profit are pretty fair measures.</p>

<p>I missed it where &#8220;Wall Street basically anointed Apple the god of capitalism&#8221;. All I noticed was that Apple&#8217;s stock price went up <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=AAPL&amp;a=09&amp;b=27&amp;c=2015&amp;d=09&amp;e=28&amp;f=2015&amp;g=d">about two percent the day after earnings were announced</a> and has since fallen back to where it was before Q4 earnings were announced.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The actual story, the story we should be telling, involves a
different narrative. Apple is the largest company in the world,
but success is fleeting. While the numbers are impressive, they
don’t come close to painting an accurate picture about how much
trouble Apple is really in.</p>

<p>Apple’s rise under Steve Jobs was historic. Its fall under Tim
Cook is going to be much slower, more painful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fall usually is more painful than the rise. Who writes a sentence like that?</p>

<p>And if Apple&#8217;s fall under Cook is much slower than its rise under Steve Jobs, it&#8217;s going to take 20 or 30 years. Apple&#8217;s revival was long, slow, and relatively steady.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple lives and dies by the iPhone. iPad sales are flat,
iPod’s are all but irrelevant, and while Mac sales are up,
they’re nowhere close to the workhorse that can continue to
carry Apple should they experience a downturn in iPhone sales.
There is no Plan B.</p>

<p>One look at the numbers tells a pretty decisive tale.</p>

<p>Percentage of revenue derived from iPhone sales:</p>

<ul>
<li>2012: 46.38%</li>
<li>2013: 52.07%</li>
<li>2014: 56.21%</li>
<li>2015: 62.54%</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the part of Clark&#8217;s piece that got my attention. It&#8217;s a common refrain these days &#8212; just search Google for &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=apple+is+too+dependent+on+iphone">Apple is too dependent on the iPhone</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>Clark makes it sound like this is because the rest of Apple&#8217;s business is in decline, whereas the truth is that the iPhone continues to grow at an astonishing rate that even Apple&#8217;s other successful products can&#8217;t match. Is it worrisome that iPad sales continue to decline? Sure. Would it be better for Apple if the iPad were selling in iPhone-esque quantities? Of course. But iPad still sold 9.9 million units and generated $4.3 billion in revenue last quarter.</p>

<p>Arguing that Apple is in trouble because the iPhone is so popular is like arguing that the ’90s-era Chicago Bulls were in trouble because Michael Jordan was so good. It&#8217;s true Jordan couldn&#8217;t play forever &#8212; and the iPhone won&#8217;t be the most profitable product in the world forever. But in the meantime, the Bulls were well-nigh unbeatable, and Apple, for now at least, is unfathomably profitable.<sup id="fnr1-2015-11-13"><a href="#fn1-2015-11-13">1</a></sup> Just like how it&#8217;s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all, it&#8217;s better to have tremendous success for some period of time than never to have had tremendous success in the first place. Right?</p>

<p>What I don&#8217;t get is why Apple gets singled out for its singular success, but other companies don&#8217;t. <a href="https://investor.google.com/financial/tables.html">92 percent of Google&#8217;s revenue last year came from online advertising</a>. And more importantly, I don&#8217;t get why Apple&#8217;s non-iPhone businesses are so quickly written off only because they&#8217;re so much smaller than the iPhone.</p>

<p><a href="http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/q4fy15datasum.pdf">Apple&#8217;s total revenue for last quarter</a> was $51.5 billion. The iPhone accounted for $32.2 billion of that, which means Apple&#8217;s non-iPhone business generated about $19.3 billion in revenue. All of Microsoft in the same three months: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/investor/EarningsAndFinancials/Earnings/PressReleaseAndWebcast/FY16/Q1/default.aspx">around $21 billion</a>. <a href="https://investor.google.com/earnings/2015/Q3_google_earnings.html">All of Google</a>: $18.78 billion. <a href="http://investor.fb.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=940609">Facebook</a>: $4.5 billion. Take away every single iPhone sold &#8212; all of them &#8212; and Apple&#8217;s remaining business for the quarter was almost as big as Microsoft&#8217;s, bigger than Google&#8217;s, and more than four times the size of Facebook&#8217;s. And this is for the July-September quarter, not the October-December holiday quarter in which Apple is strongest.</p>

<p>Nothing in the world compares to Apple&#8217;s iPhone business, including anything else Apple makes. But a multi-billion-per-quarter business here (Mac), a multi-billion-per-quarter business there (iPad), a &#8220;<a href="http://www.asymco.com/2015/01/22/bigger-than-hollywood/">Services&#8221; division</a> that generates more revenue than Facebook, and an &#8220;Other&#8221; category (Watch, Apple TV, Beats, iPod) that booked $3 billion in a non-holiday quarter &#8212; and it&#8217;s clear that Apple&#8217;s non-iPhone businesses, combined, amount to a massive enterprise. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a Larry Dignon column about whether iPad Pro will make &#8220;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pros-tall-order-making-the-ipad-material-to-apple-agai/">iPad material to Apple again</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple&#8217;s iPad sales are on the borderline of being immaterial to
the company, but some analysts are betting that enterprise sales
of the iPad Pro can turn the product line around. [&#8230;]</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the iPad franchise is sucking wind relative to the
iPhone. Apple&#8217;s annual report shows the iPad is 10 percent of
overall sales. Once a business falls below 10 percent a company
doesn&#8217;t have to break it out. In other words, the iPad could be
lumped into &#8220;other&#8221; with the Apple Watch and iPod if current
trends continue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a product line that, in and of itself, generated just about exactly the same revenue <em>last quarter</em> as all of Google&#8217;s non-advertising business did for the <em><a href="https://investor.google.com/financial/tables.html">entire fiscal year</a></em>. But Apple is the company that is considered lopsided and worrisomely dependent upon a single product.</p>

<p>Name a product introduced in the last five years that has been more successful than the iPad &#8212; either in terms of revenue and profit for its maker, or in terms of aggregate hours of daily use and customer satisfaction of its users. I can&#8217;t think of one.</p>

<p>Now consider the Apple Watch. <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3048375/why-the-apple-watch-is-flopping">Fast Company called it &#8220;a flop&#8221; back in July</a>. Here&#8217;s a guy on Quora &#8212; Jason Lancaster, editor of a website  called <a href="http://www.accurateautoadvice.com/">Accurate Auto Advice</a> &#8212; answering, in the affirmative, <a href="https://www.quora.com/Has-Apple-already-lost-the-market-for-self-driving-cars">whether Apple has &#8220;already lost the market for self driving cars&#8221;</a> (not joking):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Third, Apple may have peaked. Call me a hater, but what reason is
there to assume Apple&#8217;s reputation is going to stay where it is?
The watch was a flop, and their only consistent source of success
is the iPhone, as the market for Macs and iPads is drying up (as
it is for all computer hardware companies).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Forget the fact that Mac sales are <em>growing</em>, or that iPad sales, though in decline, remain roughly 10 million per quarter. What I enjoy about this is Lancaster&#8217;s having written off the Watch as a flop &#8212; he even uses the past tense.</p>

<p><a href="http://recode.net/2015/11/04/canalys-estimates-apple-has-shipped-seven-million-watches-fewer-than-some-projected/">Here&#8217;s what that flop looks like</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has shipped seven million Apple Watches since its
introduction this spring, giving the technology giant a firm lead
in the nascent smartwatch market, according to researcher Canalys.</p>

<p>That number falls shy of some Wall Street analysts’ expectations
for Apple’s first new device category since 2010. But, for
perspective, consider this: Apple sold more smartwatches from
April through September than all other vendors combined sold over
the past five quarters, Canalys reports.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we estimate the average selling price for an Apple Watch at $500 (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/30/us-apple-watch-idUSKCN0RU1AA20150930">reasonable</a>), that&#8217;s $3.5 billion in revenue for the year to date &#8212; prior to the holiday quarter that is almost certainly going to be the strongest for watch sales annually.</p>

<hr />

<p>Back to Bryan Clark&#8217;s TheNextWeb piece:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Steve Jobs is almost entirely responsible for Apple’s cult-like
following.</p>

<p>By streamlining the company in an attempt to make it profitable,
the same vision started to makes its way through every product
Apple created. Rather than bloated and flashy, Jobs created a
movement of decidedly minimalist devices that required not much
more than an occasional charge and a user that knew where the
power button was.</p>

<p>Between aesthetically pleasing design, rock-solid hardware, and
software that responded as if it were built for the machine &#8212;
not in spite of it &#8212; Apple culture became a cult of
Jobs-worshipping consumers willing to buy anything with a
lowercase “i” in front of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That never happened. The G4 Cube didn&#8217;t sell. iPod Hi-Fi didn&#8217;t sell. Those weren&#8217;t just non-hit products &#8212; they were both products that Steve Jobs himself really liked. I&#8217;ve heard that he had a stack of unopened iPod Hi-Fis in his office. Apple products have never been blindly accepted by the mass market &#8212; they&#8217;ve succeeded on their merits and by meeting actual demand. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/12/the_year_in_apple_and_technology">As I wrote two years ago</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To posit that Apple customers are somehow different, that when
they feel screwed by Apple their response is to go back for more,
is “Cult of Mac” logic &#8212; the supposition that most Apple
customers are irrational zealots or trend followers who just
mindlessly buy anything with an Apple logo on it. The truth is the
opposite: Apple’s business is making customers happy, and keeping
them happy. They make products for discriminating people who have
higher standards and <em>less</em> tolerance for design flaws or
problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clark finally tells us what Apple&#8217;s biggest problems are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are larger issues on the horizon: For example, how does
Apple compete with Windows and Android?</p>

<p>Both have proven to be amazingly adept in recent years not only at
competing with Apple in form factor, but functionality as well.</p>

<p>Two companies that are innovating, not searching for identity
outside of a singular product.</p>

<p>Two companies that are on the way up, not down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Windows and Android, got it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Apple Watch is great, but it’s never going to carry Apple like
the iPhone until it works like one. The watch is undeniably cool,
but it really fails to do anything better than your phone.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, you have to have an iPhone close by in
order to even use most of its features. Similar Android models are
self-contained and only require an occasional sync.</p>

<p>The autonomous car project sounds promising, but competing against
Google and Tesla in addition to auto industry giants like Lexus
and Mercedes is an uphill battle full of technology challenges,
government red tape and changing century-old transportation
conventions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best I can gather from this mishmash of a conclusion is that Apple Watch should have somehow debuted as a first-generation product that could stand toe-to-toe with the iPhone (which is now in its ninth generation), and that Apple&#8217;s car product should already be here. If there were no rumors of an Apple car, we&#8217;d be hearing that Apple is going to miss out on the next big industry  that is ripe for disruption from the tech industry. But because there <em>are</em> rumors and hints pointing to an Apple car, we&#8217;re hearing that cars are too difficult, the established companies too entrenched. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2006/11/colligan_head_stuck">Ed Colligan&#8217;s line for the ages</a> &#8212; &#8220;<em>PC guys are not going to just figure this out. They’re not going to just walk in.</em>&#8221; &#8212; was also about an industry full of longstanding giants, Google, technology challenges, government red tape, and century-old conventions.  Minus the &#8220;government red tape&#8221;, that&#8217;s a pretty good description of the watch and home entertainment system industries, too.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not here to argue the opposite of Colligan &#8212; that Apple&#8217;s success in these new fields is preordained &#8212; because that would be foolish. But it&#8217;s just as foolish to argue that Apple <em>can&#8217;t</em> succeed &#8212; or that anything less than iPhone-sized success in a new endeavor is a failure.</p>

<p>First impressions last a lifetime, goes the adage. You&#8217;re going to have to forget your first impressions of the iPad to understand the iPad Pro.</p>

<p>When Apple introduced the original iPad in 2010, it was explicitly positioned in a new role for a device &#8212; somewhere between an iPhone and a MacBook. That seems obvious, but the problem, for the iPad, is that people loved their iPhones and MacBooks. The only way iPad would succeed, Steve Jobs said, was if it were &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/28/technology/companies/28apple.html">far better at doing some key things</a>&#8221; than <em>either</em> an iPhone or MacBook.</p>

<p>Apple succeeded. Simply by nature of having a bigger display, the iPad was better than the iPhone for numerous tasks &#8212; watching videos or reading long-form text, to name just two. No one would dispute that bigger displays are better for certain tasks &#8212; you can <em>prove</em> <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/productivity-and-screen-size/">the productivity gains</a>.</p>

<p>What made the iPad better than a MacBook, in at least some ways, was more subjective than objective. Objectively, a MacBook was faster, by a large factor, could multitask, and offered a rich library of serious productivity apps. A Mac was, simply put, more powerful than an iPad &#8212; both in terms of hardware and software. The iPad had <em>some</em> objective advantages &#8212; battery life and the pixel density of its display are two that come to mind.<sup id="fnr1-2015-11-11"><a href="#fn1-2015-11-11">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The trade-offs were obvious. The iPad offered the same conceptual simplicity and intimacy as the iPhone, with the &#8220;lean-back&#8221; ergonomics of a tablet, at the cost of <em>power</em> &#8212; hardware performance and software complexity.</p>

<p>It was, in short, <em>just a big iPhone</em>. To the eyes of many in the tech industry, &#8220;just a big iPhone&#8221; was damning. They wanted the iPad to impress in terms of power. To the eyes of tens of millions of users, however, &#8220;just a big iPhone&#8221; was strong praise. An iPhone with a 10-inch display sounded just great.</p>

<p>The intervening five years have turned all of this upside down. The iPad Pro now impresses solely by dint of its engineering. Anyone who doesn&#8217;t see this is blinded by their established impressions of the first few iPads.</p>

<p>For the moment, put aside the form factor differences (tablet with optional keyboard vs. hinged clamshell), conceptual differences in iOS and OS X (direct touchscreen manipulation of full-screen apps vs. a mouse pointer and tiled windows) and software differences (simpler iOS apps vs. more complex OS X apps). All those points are worth consideration, but for now, put them aside. Right now, today, the iPad Pro is a peer to the current lineup of MacBooks in terms of computational hardware performance.</p>

<p>The iPad Pro is without question faster than the new one-port MacBook or the latest MacBook Airs. I&#8217;ve looked at several of my favorite benchmarks &#8212; <a href="http://www.primatelabs.com/geekbench/">Geekbench 3</a>, <a href="http://krakenbenchmark.mozilla.org/">Mozilla&#8217;s Kraken</a>, and <a href="https://developers.google.com/octane/?hl=en">Google&#8217;s Octane 2</a> &#8212; and the iPad Pro is a race car. It&#8217;s only a hair slower than my year-old 13-inch MacBook Pro in single-core measurements. Graphics-wise, testing with GFXBench, it blows my MacBook Pro away. <em>A one-year-old maxed-out MacBook Pro, rivaled by an iPad in performance benchmarks.</em> Just think about that. According to Geekbench&#8217;s online results, the iPad Pro is faster in single-core testing than Microsoft&#8217;s new Surface Pro 4 with a Core-i5 processor. The Core-i7 version of the Surface Pro 4 isn&#8217;t shipping until December &#8212; that model will almost certainly test faster than the iPad Pro. But that&#8217;s a $1599 machine with an Intel x86 CPU. The iPad Pro starts at $799 and runs an ARM CPU &#8212; Apple&#8217;s A9X. There is no more trade-off. You don&#8217;t have to choose between the performance of x86 and the battery life of ARM.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve now reached an inflection point. The new MacBook is slower, gets worse battery life, and even its cheapest configuration <em>costs $200 more</em> than the top-of-the-line iPad Pro. The iPad Pro is more powerful, cheaper, has a better display, and gets better battery life. It&#8217;s not a clear cut-and-dry win &#8212; MacBooks still have more RAM (the iPad Pro, in all configurations, has 4 GB of RAM, although Apple still isn&#8217;t publishing this information &#8212; MacBook Pros have either 8 or 16 GB), are expandable, and offer far more storage. But at a fundamental level &#8212; CPU speed, GPU speed, quality of the display, quality of the sound output, and overall responsiveness of interface &#8212; the iPad Pro is a better computer than a MacBook or MacBook Air, and a worthy rival to the far more expensive MacBook Pros.</p>

<p>The entire x86 computer architecture is living on borrowed time. It&#8217;s a dead platform walking. The future belongs to ARM, and Apple&#8217;s A-series SoC&#8217;s are leading the way.</p>

<p>The A9X didn&#8217;t come out of nowhere. Watching Apple&#8217;s A-series chips gain on x86 over the past five years, we&#8217;ve all been speculating about whether Apple might someday start using ARM chips in MacBooks. As of now, it&#8217;s only a question of whether they want to.</p>

<h2>What Apple Means by &#8216;Pro&#8217;</h2>

<p>With the Mac Pro, the &#8220;pro&#8221; really does stand for &#8220;professional&#8221;. There&#8217;s pretty much no reason for anyone to buy a Mac Pro unless their work is computationally expensive. There aren&#8217;t many people left whose work is slowed down regularly by the performance of their computer. The Mac Pro is aimed at that market. (That said, a higher-end iMac will outperform a Mac Pro in many tasks that aren&#8217;t well-suited to multicore parallel computing. The Mac Pro is due for an update.)</p>

<p>With the MacBook Pro, on the other hand, &#8220;pro&#8221; isn&#8217;t really short for &#8220;professional&#8221;. It&#8217;s more like &#8220;deluxe&#8221; &#8212; a signifier that it&#8217;s a higher-end product than its non-pro siblings. Faster, better, and accordingly higher-priced. A MacBook Pro with 1 TB of SSD storage is indeed a terrific portable computer for &#8220;professional&#8221; use by, say, a photographer or film editor or software developer &#8212; people who truly stretch the performance of any computer today, portable or otherwise. But a decked-out MacBook Pro is also a terrific and perfectly reasonable choice for anyone who can simply afford one. MacBook Airs don&#8217;t have retina displays (and likely will never be upgraded to offer them), and the one-port MacBook is relatively slow.</p>

<p>The iPad Pro is &#8220;pro&#8221; in the way MacBook Pros are. Genuine professionals with a professional need &#8212; visual artists in particular &#8212; are going to line up for them. But it&#8217;s also a perfectly reasonable choice for casual iPad users who just want a bigger display, louder (and now stereo) speakers, and faster performance.</p>

<p>Anyone <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/mobile/ios/7740/thinking-about-the-ipad-pro">tying themselves in knots</a> looking for a specific target audience for the iPad Pro is going about it the wrong way. There is no single target audience. Is the iPad Pro meant for office workers in the enterprise? Professional artists creating content? Casual users playing games, watching movies, and reading? The answer is simply &#8220;Yes&#8221;. </p>

<h2>Smart Keyboard and Converting to a Laptop Form Factor</h2>

<p>So unlike the original iPad of 2010, which carved out new territory between that of an iPhone and MacBook, the iPad Pro is clearly an alternative to a MacBook. I&#8217;m sure someone out there will carry both a MacBook (of any sort) and an iPad Pro while traveling, but I don&#8217;t really see the sense of that. The iPad Mini makes perfect sense as a travel companion to a MacBook. The iPad Air does too &#8212; especially for someone who watches a lot of video or prefers larger type while reading. But the iPad Pro stands as an alternative to a MacBook. If you want to carry a MacBook, you want a smaller, lighter iPad as a companion, and you don&#8217;t need a keyboard for it. If you want to carry an iPad Pro, you might as well get the Smart Keyboard cover and leave the MacBook at home.</p>

<p>The trade-offs are varied. If you don&#8217;t type much, or don&#8217;t mind using the on-screen keyboard when you do, you&#8217;re probably already sold on the iPad-as-primary-portable-computer lifestyle. If you do type a lot and want a hardware keyboard, the appeal of the iPad Pro is going to largely hinge on your affinity for the Smart Keyboard.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using this iPad Pro review unit (128 GB, with cellular &#8212; top of the line kit, natch) for eight days, and most of that time I&#8217;ve had the Smart Keyboard attached. For just plain typing, it&#8217;s not that bad &#8212; I&#8217;ve written this entire review using it, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-9-review/">Federico Viticci-style</a>. I went into it thinking that my biggest complaint would be the keys themselves &#8212; I like my keyboards clicky, with a lot of travel. But I adjusted to it pretty quickly, and I kind of like the way it feels, as a tactile surface. It almost feels like canvas.</p>

<p>My complaints and frustrations are more from the software, both iOS 9.1 itself and individual apps, both from Apple and third-party developers. Trying to use the iPad Pro as a laptop with the Smart Keyboard exposes the seams of an OS that was clearly designed for touchscreen use first. These seams aren&#8217;t new &#8212; I&#8217;m sure anyone who has tried using an iPad of any sort with a paired Bluetooth keyboard has run into the same things. This is simply the first time I&#8217;ve tried using an iPad with a hardware keyboard for an extended period for large amounts of work.</p>

<p>I almost wrote &#8220;for large amounts of writing&#8221; in the preceding paragraph, but the problems with an iPad and a hardware keyboard are more than about typing. A large part of my work is <em>reading</em>, and with a laptop, the keyboard is a big part of the reading experience. In fact, with the iPad Pro, the keyboard is even more important than it is on a MacBook &#8212; and today, it falls short.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what I mean. First, when the iPad Pro is open with the keyboard attached, holding your arm up to touch the screen for anything longer than a moment or two is ergonomically uncomfortable. Apple has stated for years that this is why they don&#8217;t make the displays on MacBooks or iMacs touchscreens (that, combined with the relatively tiny click targets of Mac OS X, which are designed for very precise mice and trackpads, not imprecise finger tips). Scrolling through a long document using the iPad Pro touch screen is uncomfortable when it&#8217;s in laptop position. Going through a slew of new emails, likewise. In laptop mode, I want to use the keyboard for these things &#8212; and in most cases, because of bugs and/or software limitations, I can&#8217;t. That the keyboard falls short in these cases is even worse on iPad than it would be on a MacBook, because a MacBook has a trackpad. The point is, if my fingers are on the keyboard, I don&#8217;t want to move my hands. With a trackpad, I don&#8217;t have to. With the iPad Pro, I do.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an ancient (meaning dating back to the Classic era) Mac convention that in a read-only scrolling view, you can use the space bar to page down. When your eyes get to the bottom of the display, you can just hit space and the view should scroll to show the next screen full of content &#8212; with the last line or two of the previous screen now repeated at the top of the new screen to provide context as your eyes move from the bottom to the top of the display. This works almost everywhere on OS X, and anywhere it doesn&#8217;t work should be considered a bug.</p>

<p>On iOS 9.1, Safari tries to support this, but it is dreadfully buggy. Instead of paging down just less than one screen-height of content, it pages down about 1.5 screen-heights of content. It literally scrolls right past huge amounts of content, rendering the feature completely unusable. </p>

<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/misc/test/1000.text">Here&#8217;s a sample page I&#8217;ve created to illustrate</a>. It&#8217;s just a simple text file with 1,000 lines, numbered in order. When I view that on my MacBook Pro, I see lines 1–45 (and half of line 46). When I hit space to page, the view scrolls and I now see lines 44–89. Hit space again and the view scrolls to show lines 88–132.</p>

<p>On iPad Pro, I see lines 1–49 initially. But when I hit space to page down, the view scrolls to show me lines 75–123. Lines 50–74 are completely skipped past. It&#8217;s not even just a line or two &#8212; it&#8217;s huge chunks of text. This happens in all web pages in Safari on iOS 9.1, and it is not specific to the iPad Pro and Smart Keyboard. I see the exact same behavior on any iPad with a paired Bluetooth keyboard.</p>

<p>Mail is another app in which, on my Macs, I depend heavily on the keyboard for scrolling and selection. On iPad, Mail does let you move from message to message using the keyboard (⌘↓ and ⌘↑), but it doesn&#8217;t support scrolling the actual message content &#8212; the space bar does nothing, and the Smart Keyboard doesn&#8217;t have a proper Page Down key.</p>

<p>The space bar doesn&#8217;t work as a Play/Pause toggle for audio or video, either. I think it should.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s inherently problematic that iOS has no conceptual support for a mouse pointer, and thus <em>can&#8217;t</em> work with any sort of trackpad. But, given this constraint, good support for navigating as much of the UI as possible using the keyboard is more important on the iPad than it is on the Mac. But iOS&#8217;s support for navigating using the keyboard is <em>worse</em>.</p>

<p>Another problem: when editing a long document, if you use the arrow keys to move the insertion point above the first line on screen or below the last line on screen, the insertion point just disappears off screen. The view doesn&#8217;t scroll to keep the insertion point visible, which is clearly what should happen (and does happen on OS X). Surely iOS will work this way eventually, but right now it still shows its roots as a touchscreen OS where a hardware keyboard is a decided second-class citizen.</p>

<p>All is not lost, however. ⌘-Tab works for app switching just like it does on the Mac. Tap it and release and you switch to the most-recently used app. Tap it and keep holding down ⌘ and you get a visual switcher showing the 10 most-recently-used apps. (Again, this works with any hardware keyboard connected to any iPad &#8212; it&#8217;s just that this has been the first time it&#8217;s been relevant to me, personally.) The Smart Keyboard lacks a Home button, but there is a system-wide shortcut that maps ⌘-Shift-H to &#8220;Home&#8221;. Not bad, but once you&#8217;re at the iOS home screen, there&#8217;s not much you can do without touching the screen. For a few days, I sort of wished that I could use the arrow keys to navigate the home screen, with the selected app icon popping &#8220;up&#8221; like in the &#8220;focus&#8221; UI of the new Apple TV. But that idea, I suspect, is too far afield from the regular touchscreen-based UI of the iOS home screen. My keyboard idea requires a select-then-act two-stage model &#8212; the regular touch-based launcher is single-stage: just tap.</p>

<p>But then I realized that the problem I wanted to solve wasn&#8217;t that I wanted the home screen to be keyboard-navigable. The problem was that I wanted to use the keyboard to launch apps that weren&#8217;t listed in the ⌘-Tab switcher. To do that on iOS without a hardware keyboard, you go home, then tap the app. With a keyboard, though, you can do it, just in a different way.</p>

<p>Hit ⌘-Space system wide, and you&#8217;ll be taken to the home screen&#8217;s system-wide &#8220;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201285">Quick Search</a>&#8221;. It&#8217;s like the iOS equivalent of Spotlight. Start typing the name of the app you want to launch, and there it is.</p>

<p>But go ahead and play a sad trombone <em>wah-wah</em> here, because at this point, you still have to pick your arm up and touch the screen to launch the app. You can also use Quick Search for starting a web search in Safari, or anything else. But you can&#8217;t use the keyboard arrow keys to navigate the list of results. (Another problem with Quick Search using the keyboard: you have to wait a second or so for the Quick Search text field to accept input. I&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re waiting for the animation to complete &#8212; first to show the home screen, then to jump to Quick Search. So if you type ⌘-Space and immediately begin typing what you&#8217;re looking for, the first few characters you type are lost. The user should never have to wait for the computer, especially if it&#8217;s just for an animation. Any Mac user with muscle memory trained by LaunchBar, Alfred, Quicksilver, or even Spotlight is going to find this enforced delay on iOS maddening.)</p>

<p>This lack of keyboard support is prevalent system-wide. In Messages, if you start a new conversation and type the partial name of a contact, you can&#8217;t select from the list of matches using arrow keys or auto-complete the name you&#8217;ve partially typed using Tab. You&#8217;ve got to &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; reach up and touch the screen. You <em>can</em> use the arrow keys to select from a list of suggestions in the recipients fields in Mail, however, and arrow keys also work for selecting from the list of suggestions in the Safari location field.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that the potential of the iPad Pro as a laptop is tremendous. The keyboard is just fine for typing, and the magnetic connection between the iPad Pro and the keyboard is surprisingly sturdy. You can absolutely use it as a literal laptop without any worry that the iPad Pro is going to fall off the Smart Keyboard. I even like the 4:3 aspect ratio &#8212; it shows more lines of text when reading than my 13-inch MacBook Pro. It also occupies a smaller footprint than an open MacBook Pro, meaning it should fit better on the seatback tray of an airplane. But the lack of pervasive support for keyboard-based UI navigation in iOS is a problem for anyone with longstanding Mac keyboard shortcuts ingrained in their muscle memory.</p>

<p>As an actual cover, the Smart Keyboard does feel thick, and when closed, it bothers me a little that it&#8217;s thicker on the outer two thirds (where the keyboard is folded under) than the inner third. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend the Smart Keyboard for anyone who doesn&#8217;t plan to actually use the keyboard quite a bit. But if you do plan on using the keyboard frequently, the trade-off in thickness (compared to the non-keyboard Smart Cover) is well worth it.</p>

<p>(It occurs to me that for many people, the Smart Keyboard might best be thought of not as a thick cover, but as a thin very portable desktop docking station.)</p>

<h2>Keyboard Bugs</h2>

<p>I experienced some flakiness with the keyboard throughout the week. Sometimes, system-wide keyboard shortcuts would stop working: ⌘-Tab, ⌘-Space, and ⌘-Shift-H. Typing within apps still worked, and keyboard shortcuts within any given app still worked, but the system-wide shortcuts inexplicably stopped working. </p>

<p>Less frequently, I&#8217;ve seen the opposite problem: the system-wide keyboard shortcuts work, but keyboard shortcuts within any given app stop working. (iOS 9 has a very clever feature, by the way: press and hold the ⌘ key and you&#8217;ll see a HUD pop-up displaying all keyboard shortcuts available in the current context. This makes keyboard shortcuts <em>more</em> discoverable than they are on the Mac, where they&#8217;re spread across multiple menus in the menu bar.)</p>

<p>In either case, I&#8217;ve been able to fix these keyboard problems by detaching and re-attaching the iPad from the Smart Keyboard. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a bug in iOS 9.1 or a faulty Smart Keyboard. (Apple has shipped me a second Smart Keyboard to test, but it won&#8217;t arrive until later in the day, after this review has been published. I&#8217;ll update it after the replacement arrives.)</p>

<h2>Apple Pencil</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s about precision: accuracy where you touch (Apple claims sub-pixel precision on screen), accuracy regarding pressure, and low latency regarding what you see on screen. I am not an illustrator, but I do know my own signature. My signature never looks like my actual signature when I have to sign electronically on a point-of-sale terminal. Usually it doesn&#8217;t even look close. On iPad Pro with Apple Pencil, it looks exactly like my signature when I sign with paper and ink. My handwriting looks like my handwriting, period (for better or for worse).</p>

<p>All previous iOS devices have touchscreens designed for input from one source: fingertips. Fingertips are relatively fat and capacitive. The relatively fat size and imprecise location of a finger on screen is why tap targets are relatively larger and more spaced apart on iOS than OS X. This is also why third-party styluses for iOS devices have broad tips made of capacitive rubber &#8212; they&#8217;re more or less fake fingertips. The capacitive touchscreens on iPhones and (non-Pro) iPads aren&#8217;t designed for &#8220;fine tips&#8221;.</p>

<p>Apple has done a few things regarding sampling the screen for input with Apple Pencil. First, there is something new in the display itself &#8212; something in the layer between the glass surface and the LCD display, I think. Or perhaps it&#8217;s under the LCD? Apple alludes to it in <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/">the Jony Ive-narrated video on the Apple Pencil web page</a>, but they&#8217;re not really talking about it in detail.</p>

<p>For capacitive (finger) touch, the iPad Pro samples at twice the rate of previous iPads &#8212; 120 times per second instead of 60. With the Pencil, though, the iPad Pro samples 240 times per second. The way the Pencil works requires cooperation with the display, and so there&#8217;s no way this Pencil could be made to work with existing iPads. The Pencil is not iPad Pro-exclusive out of product marketing spite &#8212; it&#8217;s exclusive to the Pro because the two were engineered in coordination with each other. And if Apple had designed the Pencil differently, to allow it to work with existing iPads, there&#8217;s no way it could have had this level of accuracy, because the tip would have needed to be broader and capacitive. (The Pencil&#8217;s tip is not capacitive at all &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t register as a touch <em>at all</em> on any other iOS device.)</p>

<p>My guess is we&#8217;ll start to see Pencil support in future iOS devices in addition to the iPad Pro, starting with the iPad Air 3.</p>

<p>Because the Pencil is round-barreled and has no clip on the cap, I was worried that it would roll around (and eventually, off) a table top. But it&#8217;s actually weighted inside, sort of like a <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dFzhjnjXc2o">Weeble Wobble</a>, so unless it&#8217;s on a sloped surface, it won&#8217;t roll more than an inch or so before settling in place. In hand, I can&#8217;t tell that it&#8217;s weighted like this.</p>

<p>I think most people who buy an iPad Pro are going to want a Smart Keyboard. The Apple Pencil is the more technically remarkable peripheral, but I suspect it&#8217;ll prove useful to far fewer people. Sketching apps like <a href="https://www.fiftythree.com/">53&#8217;s Paper</a> and Apple&#8217;s own built-in Notes app certainly have appeal and utility to people who aren&#8217;t artists, but I suspect a lot of Apple Pencils are going to be bought out of curiosity and then go largely unused.</p>

<p>For actual illustrators and artists, however, the Pencil and iPad Pro seem poised to be a career/industry-changing combination. What has been largely abstract &#8212; drawing using a device over <em>here</em>, looking at the results on a screen over <em>there</em> &#8212; can now be direct.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> The iPad Pro certainly feels heavier than recent iPads, but only in a way that&#8217;s commensurate with its increased size. It&#8217;s not too heavy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Audio:</strong> The speakers are surprisingly loud. Apple told me the iPad Pro produces three times the audio volume of the iPad Air, and that certainly matches my experience. If you use your iPad as a small TV, the audio improvements might be more meaningful than the bigger display. The four-speaker stereo system is also very clever &#8212; no matter which way you rotate the iPad Pro, the top two speakers are for treble and the bottom two for bass.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Snap:</strong> Speaking of audio, if there&#8217;s a downside to the snug connection between the iPad Pro and the Smart Keyboard, it&#8217;s that the magnetic connection makes a rather loud <em>snap</em> when you connect or disconnect it. I can imagine some scenarios &#8212; in bed with a sleeping spouse, say &#8212; where this might be a problem.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Size classes:</strong> I think even Apple&#8217;s own apps are still figuring out how best to arrange layouts on this larger display. For example, in Mail, when the iPad Pro is in portrait, it only shows one column at a time. I think there&#8217;s clearly enough room horizontally, even in portrait, for a two-pane layout (narrow list of messages on left, wide message detail on right). The iPad Pro in portrait is as wide as the iPad Air in landscape &#8212; and the iPad Air in landscape uses two panes for Mail. Third-party developers are going to want to adjust their apps after they get a feel for what it&#8217;s like to use the iPad Pro for real.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Battery life:</strong> Simply outstanding. I didn&#8217;t even plug it in once between Monday and Friday, and it still had plenty of charge left. I&#8217;ve been using it for eight continuous hours as I type this sentence, and it still has more than a 50 percent charge remaining.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Missing apps:</strong> It&#8217;s been like this ever since the original iPad, but it still strikes me as odd that the iPad version of iOS lacks the Calculator, Weather, and Stocks apps. The Mac doesn&#8217;t have &#8220;apps&#8221; for Weather or Stocks, but it does have widgets for them in Notification Center. And it seems downright crazy for a computer not to have a built-in means for doing arithmetic. (Although you can do some arithmetic using Quick Search.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Touch, Don&#8217;t Touch:</strong> For the past week I&#8217;ve really only used two computers. The iMac on my desk, and this iPad Pro. Today, though, I used my MacBook Pro while the iPad Pro was running benchmarks. And within a few minutes, I did something I have never once done before: I reached up and tried to touch something on the display. Ten minutes later I did it again. I point this out not to argue that I think MacBooks should have touch screens, but simply as an observation that even a lifelong Mac user can quickly get accustomed to the iPad Pro as a laptop.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>From a hardware perspective, the iPad Pro strikes me as a seminal device. It  runs faster than the Intel x86-based MacBooks, gets better battery life, and costs significantly less. And it has a better display with significantly more pixels than even a 15-inch MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Software-wise, support for the Smart Keyboard needs to get even smarter &#8212; but I&#8217;d be shocked if it doesn&#8217;t. For me, the iPad Pro marks the turning point where iPads are no longer merely lightweight (both physically and conceptually) alternatives to MacBooks for use in simple scenarios, to where MacBooks will now start being seen as heavyweight alternatives to iPads for complex scenarios.<sup id="fnr2-2015-11-11"><a href="#fn2-2015-11-11">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Is it a MacBook replacement for me, personally? No. For you? Maybe. For many people? Yes.</p>

<p>It brings me no joy to observe this, but the future of mass market portable computing involves neither a mouse pointer nor an x86 processor.</p>

	<content type="html" xml:base="http://daringfireball.net/" xml:lang="en"><![CDATA[
<p>The pattern is pretty clear. In even-numbered years (2008, 2010, 2012, 2014) Apple releases all-new iPhone form factors: 3G, 4, 5, 6/6 Plus. In the subsequent years, they release &#8220;S&#8221; variants: iPhones that look nearly identical to their predecessors, but with improved components.</p>

<p>Why do they do this?</p>

<p>There are some ecosystem advantages to this tick-tock<sup id="fnr1-2015-09-22"><a href="#fn1-2015-09-22">1</a></sup> schedule. Most iPhone cases, for example, fit both the tick and tock iPhones. (The rare exceptions are certain hard cases with extremely tight tolerances. The iPhones 6S, for example, are both a few tenths of a millimeter bigger, wider, and thicker than their corresponding siblings from last year.) I think there are some branding advantages to this two-year cycle as well. iPhones are iconic devices. The devices themselves are recognizable. Keeping each new form factor around for two model years lets that iconic appearance seep deeper into the mass market collective consciousness.</p>

<p>Releasing a new generation of iPhones every year &#8212; year in, year out &#8212; is an aggressive pace given the scale and scope of the iPhone, and its importance to Apple financially. Sure, other handset makers put out dozens of different models every year. But Apple is playing an entirely different game. With one exception &#8212; the iPhone 5C two years ago (a phone which, as time goes by, seems more and more curious strategically) &#8212; Apple has never made a new iPhone other than a new top-of-the-line industry-leading flagship. In  the same way that automobiles don&#8217;t change form factors every year, I don&#8217;t think it would be feasible for Apple to change the iPhone&#8217;s form factor every year. I think it takes more than a year for Apple&#8217;s design team to create a new iPhone design &#8212; at least to create a new design that is different because it is <em>better</em>, not merely different for the sake of being different.</p>

<p>The glaring downside to this tick-tock schedule is that we as a culture &#8212; and <em>particularly</em> the media, both on the tech/gadgetry side and the business side &#8212; are obsessed with &#8220;new&#8221;. And, well, the S-model iPhones don&#8217;t look new. This year there is a new rose gold aluminum finish, but at a glance, the iPhones 6S look like last year&#8217;s iPhones 6. Every year is an <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/1151235/apple_rolls.html">iterative improvement</a> over the previous one, whether it&#8217;s an S year or not. But it&#8217;s hard not to see the S years as <em>more</em> iterative, less impressive, updates, simply because they look the same.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s a trap &#8212; a way to be fooled by your eyes. If you put aside what the phones look like, the S model years have brought some of the biggest changes to the platform. The display changes came in non-S years, of course &#8212; the iPhone 4 going retina; the iPhone 5 expanding from 3.5 to 4 inches diagonally and changing the aspect ratio; and of course last year&#8217;s 6/6 Plus expanding to 4.7 and 5.5 inches and higher display resolutions. But it was the 3GS that first improved on CPU performance and gave us the first improvements to the camera. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/10/iphone_4s">The 4S</a> ushered in Siri integration and a much faster camera. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c">The 5S</a> was Apple&#8217;s first 64-bit ARM device, years ahead of the competition, and was the first device with Touch ID. For a typical iPhone user on a two-year upgrade cycle, I think the S years are the better phones, historically.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a passage from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2013/09/the_iphone_5s_and_5c">my 5S/5C review</a> two years ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Refinement, in the eyes of these naysayers, does not count as
innovation. Only revolution counts. But the iPhone needs no
revolution. It continues to sell better year-over-year, year after
year, without lowering its prices. Every step of the way between
2007 and that lone original iPhone &#8212; running an OS with no
third-party apps, no multitasking, not even copy-and-paste &#8212; and
today’s world, where Apple is on the cusp of selling its 700
millionth iOS device and the lineup ranges from the iPod Touch to
the iPhones to two sizes of iPad, has been about just that:
<em>refinement</em>.</p>

<p>The iPhone 5S shows that there remains much room for refinement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s ever been more of a trap to approach an S-model iPhone as &#8220;just a slightly improved version of last year&#8217;s iPhone&#8221; than this year.</p>

<p>I used to think &#8212; and maybe it was even true &#8212; that one of the advantages to Apple of the tick-tock cycle is that during the S years, they&#8217;re already experts at manufacturing a bunch of the components. That they&#8217;ve already got a year of experience making that case, that display, those buttons. That manufacturing-wise, Apple could just swap in a few new components, like a new A-series CPU, and call it a day. But the iPhones 6S don&#8217;t use the same case as last year&#8217;s models. They&#8217;re now made out of an altogether new &#8220;7000 series&#8221; aluminum alloy. This isn&#8217;t just a new material that needs to be obtained in massive quantities, it also requires new CNC machining to carve and polish the frames. The displays are the same sizes as last year, but Apple is using a new glass that it calls &#8220;the strongest in the smartphone industry&#8221;.<sup id="fnr2-2015-09-22"><a href="#fn2-2015-09-22">2</a></sup> Even the Touch ID sensor is new. Everything you can <em>touch</em> on the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus is new.</p>

<p>Internally, Apple has added force sensors to enable 3D Touch. They&#8217;ve replaced the chintzy old vibrating engine with a &#8220;Taptic&#8221; engine. Both LTE and Wi-Fi now support faster speeds (and LTE supports more bands, increasing compatibility with networks around the world). The camera now supports 4K video and shoots better (and bigger) still photos. On the iPhone 6S Plus, image stabilization now works with video in addition to stills. The CPU and GPU improvements in the A9 system-on-a-chip are more dramatic compared to the A8 than the A8 was to the A7.</p>

<p>Apple has even &#8212; dare I say <em>finally</em> &#8212; increased the amount of RAM, from 1 GB to 2.</p>

<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBYWGjIzvyw">The Only Thing That&#8217;s Changed Is Everything</a>&#8221; is the slogan of Apple&#8217;s marketing campaign for the iPhones 6S. I can&#8217;t beat that. I&#8217;ve been testing both models for 12 days, and what Apple is saying about the new iPhones is true. They don&#8217;t <em>look</em> new, but almost everything about them <em>is</em> new.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s backwards to think that in an S year, Apple simply takes the previous model and makes a few tweaks. Instead, I think what&#8217;s obvious is that knowing the basic industrial design at least two years ahead of time gives the engineering teams inside Apple an opportunity to make significant changes to the components and the materials used to construct them. The timeline for iPhones, because of the massive scale at which they must be manufactured, is such that, right now, as I&#8217;m typing this, the design for next year&#8217;s iPhone 7 is either locked down or very close to it. The company will now spend the next year hustling to make it work and put it into production so it can start shipping a year from now. But that means there are also teams already at work on the iPhone 7S slated for 2017 &#8212; and they have a massive head start in terms of knowing the shape and dimensions of the device.</p>

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>As usual, I&#8217;ll leave in-depth performance analysis to others, but I did run <a href="http://www.primatelabs.com/geekbench/">the Geekbench 3</a> general-purpose benchmark. All devices were running the release version of iOS 9.0. I ran the benchmark three times after restarting the device, and put all devices in airplane mode during the tests. I&#8217;ve rounded the scores to the nearest tens digit. For both the iPhone 6 and 6S, the scores for the 5.5-inch Plus models were effectively identical to the 4.7-inch models, so they aren’t broken out separately.</p>

<p>Two observations here. First, there is a noticeably bigger performance increase across the board going from the 6 to the 6S than there was last year, going from the 5S to the 6. In broad strokes, the non-S iPhones are about physical style, the S models are about performance. (At the introduction of the 3GS in 2009, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=5cvTRjPnV8c#t=139">Phil Schiller claimed the &#8220;S&#8221; stood for &#8220;speed&#8221;</a>. Since then, Apple hasn&#8217;t said what any of the S&#8217;s stand for, but &#8220;speed&#8221; still fits)</p>

<p>Second, take a look at Geekbench&#8217;s aggregate results <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/android-benchmarks">for Android</a> devices. (<a href="/misc/2015/09/android-geekbench-results-sept-2015.png">Here&#8217;s a screenshot</a> as it stands today, for posterity.) In terms of single-core performance, there isn&#8217;t a single Android phone that beats the two-year-old iPhone 5S. Android devices fare better in multi-core benchmarks, because they have more cores (some have eight, many have four &#8212; the iPhones 6S still have only two cores), but single-core performance is a better measure for the sort of things you can <em>feel</em> while using a device. Apple is literally years ahead of the industry. Even if you don&#8217;t agree that single-core performance is the more meaningful benchmark, you can&#8217;t deny that iPhone benchmarks don&#8217;t look <em>anything</em> like the benchmarks for high-end Android devices. With the Mac, Apple uses the same Intel chips as its PC competition. On mobile, though, Apple&#8217;s in-house chip team has given the company a tremendous advantage over the rest of the industry.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Mac and performance, again looking at single-core performance, <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks">Geekbench results</a> put the iPhone 6S at roughly the same score as a 2012 or 2013 MacBook Air. Even more intriguing is a comparison to the new single-port MacBook:</p>

<p><table width=500>

</table></p>

<p><em>The new iPhone 6S beats the new MacBook in single-core performance on Geekbench</em>, and is within spitting distance in multi-core. That&#8217;s astounding. I can&#8217;t wait to see the scores for the iPad Pro later this year.</p>

<h2>3D Touch</h2>

<p>3D Touch can be used in a few ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Quick Actions: The pop-up menu you see from the home screen when you press on an app icon.</p></li>
<li><p>Peek and Pop: Press a little to get a peek, press harder to pop whatever you&#8217;re peeking at open. This works mostly on list items. So in Mail, from your list of messages, you can peek to look at a message, then pop to open it all the way up. It works almost everywhere in Apple&#8217;s own apps: Messages, Camera, Maps, Weather, Safari (page previews on links), Notes, Calendar, and more. It pays to explore.</p></li>
<li><p>Multitasking: As an alternative to double-pressing the home button, you can now press on the left edge of the display. Press-and-swipe all the way across and you switch back to the previous app you were using. Press-and-swipe just a little and you&#8217;re left in the &#8220;card view&#8221; where you can switch to any previous application. The former is like hitting Command-Tab just once. The latter is like hitting Tab repeatedly while holding down the Command key. This is quickly addictive, and a great accommodation now that the iPhones are bigger than they used to be &#8212; you can switch between apps without changing your grip to allow your thumb to reach the Home button.</p></li>
<li><p>Trackpad Mode: Press on the keyboard and it turns into a trackpad. iPads running iOS 9 can trigger this trackpad mode, too, with a two-finger swipe on the keyboard. Doing it with a single finger on the iPhone, though, is a tremendous boon to text editing. This might be the single best new feature for text editing on the iPhone since the addition of selection and Copy/Paste in iOS 3 in 2009. In addition to moving the insertion point around, you can press again and switch to selection mode &#8212; like double-clicking the mouse button on a Mac. Trackpad mode is a once-you&#8217;ve-used-it-you-can&#8217;t-go-back addition to iOS.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are other uses for 3D Touch as well. When drawing in the new Notes app or using Markup to annotate an image in Mail, you can press harder to draw thicker strokes. (The same also applies when drawing Chinese characters on Chinese handwriting keyboards.) If you press on one of the new &#8220;dynamic wallpapers&#8221; on the lock screen, it animates for a few seconds, like a Live Photo. (Or you can set your lock screen wallpaper to a Live Photo you&#8217;ve taken yourself. But Apple&#8217;s &#8220;dynamic wallpapers&#8221; have a higher frame rate than the live photos you can take yourself; they&#8217;re obviously <em>like</em> live photos, but they&#8217;re not the same thing as the ones you can take with the iPhone 6S camera.)</p>

<p>The wallpaper animation is gimmicky, but fun. Most of the other uses for 3D Touch, though, are legitimate productivity gains. I find myself using the shortcuts on the icons for Messages (to jump to one of your three most-active recent threads) and Camera (to choose which mode to start in: front-facing self-portrait, video, slo-mo, or still) frequently. It&#8217;s habit-forming.</p>

<p>Peek-and-pop for, say, reading email &#8212; I wasn&#8217;t too sure about that at first. But watching <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/16/cook-colbert">Tim Cook&#8217;s appearance on Stephen Colbert</a>, I took note when Cook claimed it helps him get through his inbox faster. I tried it again, and noticed for the first time that while peeking, you can slide the message left or right to trash or archive it. It really is an efficient way to triage messages, especially ones that you can&#8217;t get the gist of from the two- or three-line preview in the message list itself. And, you can drag a message <em>up</em> to get an activity sheet with additional actions, like Reply, Forward, Notify Me, and more. The productivity gain with this workflow is that you don&#8217;t have to go &#8220;back&#8221; after finishing. Peek, swipe to the side to archive, and it&#8217;s gone. Anywhere you can peek, try sliding the peek around.</p>

<p>I have only two bad things to say about 3D Touch. First, Apple missed an opportunity to borrow a great feature from Apple Watch. On Apple Watch, you can force touch in the notification list and you get an option to Clear All. 3D Touch has no effect in iOS 9&#8217;s notification list, and there remains no way to clear all notifications at once.</p>

<p>Second, I find myself triggering the Quick Action menu inadvertently when I want to enter &#8220;jiggle mode&#8221; on the home screen, to either delete or move an app. Tap-and-wait long-pressing has always been a little frustrating to me. I don&#8217;t like to wait. I&#8217;m impatient. So when I go to move an app on the iPhone 6S, I press on it, and more often than not, I press hard enough to register as a 3D Touch. For apps that don&#8217;t have any Quick Actions (which is to say, as of this writing, all third-party apps), what happens next is that you get a wee bit of haptic feedback to let you know your press registered as a 3D Touch event, but that there are no Quick Actions for this app. It feels like two very quick gentle taps. This haptic feedback is very clever. There is no alert, and no sound. Just that little feedback that feels like the haptic equivalent of your phone telling you &#8220;<em>Uh-uh</em>&#8221;. But the experience is frustrating, because now it&#8217;s taking me even longer to enter jiggle mode: first, without thinking about what I&#8217;m doing, I accidentally trigger the &#8220;<em>Uh-uh</em>, no quick actions for this app&#8221; 3D Touch. Then I have to let go, purposefully tap-and-hold gently, and wait. I expect to get used to this over time, but at this point, 3D Touch and long-pressing feel like they&#8217;re at odds with each other.</p>

<p>Overall, it seems very clear to me that 3D Touch will spread across the entire iOS device line. Like Touch ID and retina displays, it&#8217;s simply debuting on the iPhone first.</p>

<h2>Taptic Engine</h2>

<p>Speaking of the new Taptic Engine, it&#8217;s excellent. It doesn&#8217;t just provide for 3D Touch feedback, but it also serves as the vibrator for notifications. It is stronger, more noticeable, and in my opinion more pleasing than any previous iPhone vibrator. Back in 2011, Apple switched to a superior oscillating vibrator in the iPhone 4S (and the Verizon/CDMA iPhone 4). All previous iPhones used a cheaper rotational vibrator. The oscillating vibrator in the iPhone 4S was noticeably nicer. For whatever reason, <a href="http://thenextweb.com/apple/2012/09/28/yes-iphone-5-vibrate-differently/">Apple went back to a rotational vibrator in the iPhone 5</a>, and stuck with it through the iPhone 6. The new taptic engine in the 6S feels as good or better than the old iPhone 4S vibrator. It&#8217;s just stronger and more pleasing.</p>

<p>The 3D Touch feedback is well-designed. Peeks feel gentle, pops feel stronger &#8212; sort of like a half tap and a full tap. When you press something in the interface that has only one level of 3D Touch (like the Quick Action menu on a home screen icon), you get the full-strength tap feedback, which is a way of letting you know, by feel, that there&#8217;s no reason to press harder. If you feel a peek, you know you can press hard to pop; if you feel a pop, you know you&#8217;re done. Once you get used to it, peek/pop is as intuitive as the shutter button on a camera, where you can press halfway to engage autofocus and set the exposure, and press the rest of the way to take a picture.</p>

<h2>Camera</h2>

<p>Speaking of which, the iPhone 6S cameras are terrific. They&#8217;re fast, responsive, and accurate &#8212; <em>accurate</em> meaning that unedited, right off the camera roll, the color and light reproduction look like how the scene appeared to my eyes. More than any other aspect of the iPhone, the camera exemplifies the advantages of Apple&#8217;s integration of hardware and software.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still not sure what to make of the Live Photos feature. Is it a gimmick? I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;m still shooting with the feature turned on. Technically, the way it seems to work is that the iPhone creates two files: a 12 MP JPEG (exactly the same as when you shoot a still image with Live Photo disabled), and a three-second-long MOV file. When looked at through Image Capture on a Mac running OS X 10.10.x, you see both files in the iPhone camera roll: &#8220;IMG_1234.JPG&#8221; and &#8220;IMG_1234.MOV&#8221;. Both files have same numeric index after the &#8220;IMG_&#8221; prefix, and both files have the same creation date. The MOV file is 1440 × 1080 pixels, at 12.77 frames-per-second.</p>

<p>Technically, of course, a MOV file is a video. But I think one of the reasons Apple is adamantly refusing to describe Live Photos as &#8220;video&#8221; is that these animated sidecars aren&#8217;t high-quality videos in and of themselves. That they are video files, under the hood, is just an implementation detail.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also worth emphasizing that these Live Photos are <em>not</em> implemented by burst mode. You can still engage burst mode by holding down the shutter button, but you still only get about six or seven frames per second. When taking a burst of stills, Live Photo is disabled &#8212; you just get a regular series of still images, grouped together in the camera roll just like on the iPhone 6.</p>

<p>So the way Live Photo works, I think, is this: when you&#8217;re in still photo mode with Live Photo turned on, the iPhone is constantly capturing 1440 × 1080 video at 12.77 FPS, but keeping only the most recent 1.5 seconds. Then when you tap the shutter to capture a still, it takes a 12-megapixel still image <em>in between capturing frames of the video</em>. Then the camera continues capturing another 1.5 seconds of video. So you wind up with 1.5 seconds of video prior to hitting the shutter, one still image at the maximum resolution of the image sensor, and another 1.5 seconds of video from after the shutter press. Because there is only one 12-megapixel still image captured, you can&#8217;t change the &#8220;key frame&#8221; of a Live Photo.</p>

<p>In iOS 9.0, the timing of this video capture is hard-coded. You get 3 seconds of video &#8212; 1.5 seconds on each side of the still capture &#8212; every time. This means, however, if you snap your photo and then lower the camera, you wind up with a &#8220;droop&#8221; at the end of your live photo animation &#8212; usually a blurry view of the floor. Apple has already addressed this in the betas for iOS 9.1. In 9.1, the camera will use the accelerometer to detect when you lower the camera after snapping a shot, and truncate the animation at that point. So in 9.0, all live photos are 3 seconds long, but many will have an unfortunate droop at the end. Starting in 9.1, live photos will be up to 3 seconds long, with no droops.</p>

<p><a href="/misc/2015/09/live-photo-edit-warning.jpg">You cannot edit Live Photos</a>. Well, you can edit them, but doing so turns them into stills.</p>

<p>One other camera feature demands mention, and it breaks my heart. Last year, the iPhone 6 Plus, and only the Plus, included optical image stabilization. This year, OIS remains a Plus-only feature, and Apple has made it even better, because it now works with video. The advantages of OIS for video are even greater than for still images, in my opinion. You know how when you watch a video someone shot on their phone &#8212; any phone &#8212; and when they walk around, you can see the picture rock up and down with each step they take? It&#8217;s a signature of amateur video shot on consumer cameras, and it&#8217;s unpleasant to say the least.</p>

<p>OIS for video reduces this jerkiness. And in my testing on the iPhone 6S Plus, the effect is dramatic. It&#8217;s a poor man&#8217;s Steadicam, built right into the iPhone 6S Plus. I say that this breaks my heart because, personally, I have no interest in owning the 6S Plus &#8212; I much prefer the pocketability and feel-in-hand of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6S. I could tell myself last year that the 6 Plus&#8217;s camera was only a wee bit better than the regular 6&#8217;s, and only under certain conditions. This year, OIS for video means the iPhone 6S Plus is capable of something the regular 6S is not: shooting smooth full-size videos while you walk around or pan the camera.<sup id="fnr3-2015-09-22"><a href="#fn3-2015-09-22">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Lastly, I can&#8217;t write about the camera without complaining that the bump for the lens is still there. I understand the physics and optics involved, but it bothers me every single day that I can feel that nubbin. The best argument for forgiving the camera bump is that a vast majority of iPhone owners use a case of some sort, and with a case, the camera bump is a non-issue. But for those of us who don&#8217;t use cases, and who appreciate Apple&#8217;s general attention to every little detail, it&#8217;s a very minor but daily irritation. My number one hope for next year is that Apple can continue to improve image quality while somehow getting rid of the bump.</p>

<h2>Miscellany</h2>

<li><p>One thing that hasn&#8217;t changed from last year&#8217;s iPhone 6 models: storage tiers of 16, 64, and 128 GB. The units I received for testing (one 6S, one 6S Plus) were both 128 GB. I&#8217;m sure most people can get by easily with the 64 GB models. For anyone who is not completely certain that they don&#8217;t need much storage, I would recommend against the 16 GB models. <a href="https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/09/10/16gb-is-a-bad-user-experience/">It&#8217;s too easy to fill them up</a>. I wish Apple had switched the baseline from 16 to 32 GB. 4K video is off by default (the default is 1080p at 30 FPS), but forget about shooting 4K with a 16 GB device. <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/09/10/iphone-6s-4k-video-size/">Apple says 4K video takes up 375 MB per minute</a>.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the thing that nags me whenever I complain about these 16 GB phones. My gut feeling is that they&#8217;re too small. <a href="https://david-smith.org/blog/2015/09/10/16gb-is-a-bad-user-experience/">Data from third-party app analytics</a> suggests they&#8217;re too small for many of the people who buy them. But Apple has more data on iPhone usage than anyone, and the company is obsessed with customer satisfaction. They measure customer satisfaction through surveys as accurately and scientifically as they can. How often does Tim Cook speak in public without the words &#8220;customer sat&#8221; coming out of his mouth? If last year&#8217;s 16 GB baseline adversely affected customer satisfaction, you&#8217;d think Apple would have done something about it this year, right? The only other explanation that makes sense is that it <em>does</em> adversely affect customer satisfaction, but they&#8217;re willing to take the hit in the name of higher average selling prices, because of the people who wind up buying 64 GB models who would have bought a 32 GB model for $100 less if that had been an option. Again, to me, 16/64/128 is not good/better/best &#8212; it&#8217;s OK/better/best.</p></li>
<li><p>Also seemingly unchanged from last year: the effective battery life of the device. I didn&#8217;t perform any sort of battery life tests, but in heavy daily usage, the iPhone 6S felt like it got the same battery life as the iPhone 6 I&#8217;ve been using for a year. No better, no worse. Like last year, the iPhone 6S Plus clearly gets way better battery life than the regular 6S, simply because it has room for a far larger battery.</p></li>
<li><p>The 6S models are heavier than last year&#8217;s phones: the 6S is 14 grams heavier than the 6 (143/129g); the 6S Plus is 20 grams heavier than the 6 Plus (192/172g). Some of this might be due to the new Taptic Engine (which looks bigger in Apple&#8217;s see-the-components promotional video) and the sensors for 3D Touch, but I presume most of the difference is due to the switch to higher-grade 7000-series aluminum. Well worth it for the additional structural integrity &#8212; I don&#8217;t expect any complaints about bending this year. [<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/9/12/9315471/iphone-6s-new-aluminum-doesnt-make-phone-heavier">According to The Verge</a>, most of the weight gain is from the touch sensors in the new display assembly, not the aluminum.]</p>

<p>This is subjective, but it seems to me that the new iPhones <em>feel</em> different to the touch. It&#8217;s not dramatic, but I think they&#8217;re less slippery. I&#8217;ve gone case-less with every iPhone I&#8217;ve owned, and the only one I&#8217;ve ever dropped and had the screen crack was the iPhone 6. The larger size and rounded edges made the iPhone 6 less grip-able than my beloved old iPhone 5S. It could just be the extra weight, but in blind testing, I can feel the difference between my old iPhone 6 and the new 6S. It&#8217;s just a wee bit more tacky, and it&#8217;s either due to the material, or the wear and tear of a year&#8217;s usage on my iPhone 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Apple is billing the new Touch ID sensor as &#8220;up to 2× faster&#8221;. They&#8217;re underselling it. It&#8217;s so fast now that every single time I press it, it unlocks the phone, no matter how brief the contact is between my finger and the sensor. I can sit here and try to use the home button to get to the lock screen, and I can&#8217;t unless I purposefully only touch a small portion of the button or use an unregistered finger. It&#8217;s that fast. This actually takes some getting used it, if, like me, you sometimes use the home button just to get to the lock screen to check the date or time. With the new Touch ID sensor, the home button <em>instantly</em> unlocks the phone and I need to use the sleep/wake button to get to the lock screen.</p></li>
<li><p>You know those FCC-mandated regulatory logos etched on the back of your iPhone? <a href="https://twitter.com/varunorcv/status/644937141340889088">They&#8217;re gone</a>. Last year <a href="http://www.metlabs.com/blog/emc/fcc-issues-guidance-on-new-e-labeling/">the FCC issued new guidelines</a> that allow manufacturers to put all these labels in software, for display on screen, and Apple has done just that. (You can see them in <em>Settings: General: Regulatory</em>.) It&#8217;s such a little thing, but those little turds have always bothered me. Curiously, one previous iPhone also lacked these regulatory etchings: the Verizon iPhone 4. I have no idea why that one iPhone was able to omit them but subsequent ones were not.</p>

<p>Replacing the regulatory turds is a simple &#8220;S&#8221; under the &#8220;iPhone&#8221; on the back of the phone. Previous S-model iPhones were not labeled as such.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#8217;t plan to use one, but Apple&#8217;s new cases are very nice. Both the silicone and leather cases come in nicer colors than last year &#8212; and they complement/match Apple&#8217;s lineup of Sport and leather straps for Apple Watch nicely. They really seem to have upped their game with leatherwork. Just for kicks I spent a few days of my review period with the iPhone 6S in the saddle brown case, and I really liked the way it looked and felt. It seems like the sort of leather that will look better as it ages. The biggest thing keeping me from using this case for real, going forward, is that the raised edge along the side of the display gets in the way of performing edge-based gestures, primarily swiping to go back, and the new press-and-swipe to switch between apps with 3D Touch.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>New-number iPhones (4, 5, 6) are about showing off Apple&#8217;s design prowess. The S models are about showing off Apple&#8217;s engineering prowess. Storage capacities and battery life are unchanged from last year&#8217;s iPhones. Everything else &#8212; the materials they&#8217;re made from, the performance of their custom CPU/GPU, the quality of the cameras, the smoothness of the user interface &#8212; is noticeably, tangibly improved.</p>

<p>There might be other examples, but in tech the most well-known example of this strategy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Tick-Tock">Intel&#8217;s CPU schedule</a>: one generation is a new microarchitecture (big new change) and the next is a shrinking of the previous one. What isn&#8217;t obvious is that the &#8220;tocks&#8221; are the new microarchitectures, and the &#8220;ticks&#8221; are the die shrinkings. So for iPhones, the S models are the ticks, and the new form factors are the tocks. That seems counter-intuitive, of course, because we say &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; but the tocks come before the ticks. That&#8217;s kind of stupid if you ask me, so if you want to call the new form factor models the ticks and the S models the tocks, go right ahead.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr1-2015-09-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>

<p>What does &#8220;stronger&#8221; mean? More scratch-resistant? Less prone to cracking when dropped? Both? I don&#8217;t know, and when I asked, no one at Apple would say.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2015-09-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn3-2015-09-22">
<p>There are a few apps for the iPhone that implement image-stabilization for video in software. Two that I&#8217;m aware of are <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperlapse-from-instagram/id740146917?mt=8">Hyperlapse</a> (from Instagram) and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/horizon-camera-horizontal/id778576249?mt=8">Horizon</a>. Both apps work well, but there&#8217;s no way to cheat true optical image stabilization. These apps smooth out the motion in video by cropping the frames. So you lose some resolution and wind up with a narrow field of view. The bigger downside is that you have remember to use these apps before you start shooting. When I see something I want to capture, I&#8217;m already in the system Camera app before I think about it.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr3-2015-09-22"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>

<p>iOS 9&#8217;s keyboard has a big change: the alphabetic key caps change case &#8212; they&#8217;re lowercase when typing lowercase, uppercase when Shift or Caps Lock is engaged. Android and Windows Phone keyboards have always done this.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t like it, and I&#8217;m <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffChausse/status/644716910425317376">not</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/craigmod/status/644767211505106944">alone</a>.</p>

<p>The good news: You can turn this off and go back to the way the keyboard was meant to be, with all caps alphabetic keys all the time. The confusing part: For some  reason, the setting for this is not in <em>Settings: General: Keyboard</em>. Instead, it&#8217;s in <em>Settings: General: Accessibility: Keyboard</em>.</p>

<p>Some people love this feature, so it&#8217;s great that it&#8217;s a setting. I dislike it because having the keys change automatically while I&#8217;m looking at the keyboard makes it look like it&#8217;s vibrating or flickering. I spent a week with the case-shifting enabled this summer (using the iOS 9 betas) and it drove me nuts. To me it&#8217;s distracting and looks a little cheap, and if it were up to me, it wouldn&#8217;t be the default.</p>

<p>The main argument I&#8217;ve seen <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/10/8756243/ios-9-keyboard-lowercase-shift">in favor</a> of this change holds no water: that this is the solution to iOS 7&#8217;s is-it-on-or-is-it-off? <a href="http://www.allenpike.com/2014/schrodingers-shift-key/">Schrödinger&#8217;s Shift Key</a>. The proper solution to an ambiguous Shift key is to replace it with an unambiguous Shift key. The lack of case shifting on the keyboard was not a problem on iOS 1-6 because <a href="https://darrenalawi.com/blog/fixing-the-ios-shift-key/">the Shift key on the old keyboard was unambiguous</a>. Whether you prefer a case-shifting keyboard or not, the Shift key should be unambiguous. These are two different things.</p>

<p>The good news is, Apple <em>did</em> improve the Shift key on iOS 9. When not engaged, the arrow glyph on the key cap is now hollow. When Shift is engaged, the key turns white and the arrow is solid black. With Caps Lock on, the arrow gets an underscore. </p>

<hr />

<p>One more iOS 9 change to the iPhone keyboard: there is now an option not to show the popup character preview as you type (<em>Settings: General: Keyboard: Character Preview</em>). The iPad keyboard has never shown these previews, presumably because the keys are big enough that you can see the keys themselves highlight as you tap them. Prior to iOS 9, however, the iPhone keyboard has <em>always</em> shown them.</p>

<p>While running beta versions of iOS 9 over the summer, I tried turning off character previews, but soon turned them back on. I&#8217;m just too accustomed to them after eight years of daily iPhone use. With previews off, it feels to me like the keyboard isn&#8217;t working.</p>

<p>[<strong>Update:</strong> At one point during the summer, the iOS 9 betas were <em>defaulting</em> to <em>not</em> show character previews, and I incorrectly assumed this was still the case when I first published this piece. In the release version of iOS 9.0, characters previews remain on by default, and I&#8217;ve rewritten the above accordingly. Sorry for any confusion.]</p>
